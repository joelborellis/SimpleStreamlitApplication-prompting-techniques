I'd Rather Press On     Is it my imagination or is it my iron pride I wonder if it matters much if time is on my side I'd rather press on, I don't want to rest easy Anywhere I stray I will make it a brand new day Anyway that is all I gotta say I'd rather be by the seaside than be playing a one night stand I've been too wrapped up in my own dreams I will change things if I can I gotta press on, don't want to rest easy Wouldn't it feel fine to return to the women and the wine And all of the sunshine that we knew     You will never know what blue is until you have played the game Til you live life in solitare where no one knows your name I'd rather press on, I don't want to rest easy Have it anyway you will, I will be with you right up until The spell is broken and all is well If you'd rather be by the seashore, well I sure can understand Are you too wrapped up in your own scene, I would change things if I can I'd rather press on, don't want to rest easy Wouldn't it feel fine, but remembering the rhythm and the rhymes And all of the good times makes me blue Wouldn't it feel fine to return to the women and the wine And all of the sunshine that we knew
