 The Pony Man  The Pony Man When it's midnight on the meadow and the cats are in the shed And the river tells a story at the window by my bed If you listen very closely, be as quiet as you can In the yard you'll hear him, it is the pony man We're always there to greet him when he tumbles into town He leads a string of ponies, some are white and some are brown And they never seem to kick or bite, they only want to play And they live on candy apples instead of oats and hay And when we are assembled, he gives a soft command And we climb aboard our ponies as in a row they stand Then down the road we gallop and across the fields we fly And soon we all go sailing off into the midnight sky And as we gaily rock along beside a rippling sea There's Tom and Dick and Sally and Mary Jo and me And the pony man is leading 'cause he's travelled here before And he gives a whoop and a holler at Mr. Moon's front door And then we form in single file, inside the moon we go Into a land of magic that the grownups do not know Where the streets are paved with chocolate and the trees are hung with toys And there's chewing gum for every one of the little girls and boys And then we stop to rest a while where the soda river glides Up to the slip comes a pirate ship to take us for a ride And the pony man's the captain and the children are the crew And we go in search of treasure and laugh the whole night through But then the clouds surround us and the seas begin to boil And the wind howls like a dragon as upon the decks we toil When 'longside floats a bottle which soon on board is hove With a map inside which leads us to a giant treasure trove And when the hold is filled with gold and the sails begin to strain And the deck's piled high with apple pie we head for port again Then down the whirling starcase so swift our ponies fly And we're safely in our beds again when the sunbeams kiss the sky When it's midnight on the meadow and the cats are in the shed And the river tells a story at the window by my bed If you listen very closely, be as quiet as you can In the yard you'll hear him, it is the pony man
