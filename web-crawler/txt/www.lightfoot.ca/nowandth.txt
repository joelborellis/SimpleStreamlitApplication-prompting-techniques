 Now And Then  Now And Then           I think this time You've said enough to make me want to leave this place Still I keep coming back for more of the same To fan the dying flame Here inside these walls that seem to move A little closer every day There must be a way out of this Crazy game we play out to the end  Let us just pretend a while Think about the good things now and then I think this time That was the best time that we two had ever known We tried the handle of the house upon the shore and found the open door Once inside we found a curious moonbeam doing dances on the floor We were only playing like two children who had stayed away from school Two of us could not be wrong Heaven knows who keeps the golden rule I think this time We've learned enough to know that nothing is the same But still the pounding of my heart hasn't changed and leaving's so strange Here among my thoughts of you I find a gentle longing to be free There must be a way out of this crazy game we play out to the end Take away the in between Think about the good things now and then We will see the day when you or I will stay or face up to the end Let us just pretend a while And think about the good things now and then
