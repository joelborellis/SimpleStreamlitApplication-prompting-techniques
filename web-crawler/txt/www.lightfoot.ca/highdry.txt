 High And Dry  High And Dry With ladylike devotion, she sails the bitter ocean If it wasn't for lovesick sailors there'd be nothing left but flotsam Singing why me oh my, is there a better man than I I hope you find your way back home Before you're lying high and dry I hope you find your way back home before you die  Her sails billow like bubbles, while you sip your daily doubles If she wasn't so fond of the weather she might give the deckhands trouble Singing why me oh my, is there a better man than I I hope you find your way back home Before you're lying high and dry I hope you find your way back home before you die One day when I grew older and I found I could not hold her She took on a fine young skipper who soon run her up on a boulder Singing why me oh my, is there a better man than I I hope you find your way back home Before you're lying high and dry I hope you find your way back home before you die Now the pleasures of the harbour, don't include a lady barber If it wasn't for Long John Silver all of us pirates would've been martyrs Singing why me oh my, is there a better man than I I hope you find your way back home Before you're lying high and dry I hope you find your way back home Before you're lying high and dry I hope you find your way back home before you die
