 Plans Of My Own  Plans Of My Own       I got  no time to rest, there's nothing I do best   But try so hard sometimes, I almost stand the test   With a vocal and my guitar, no place is too far   'Cause I would travel anywhere, to be right where you are       Every season I have seen since I was a baby   Says to continue in my flight       Every sign that I behold as I journey onward   Tells me there's things to be set right       As of today I've got plans of my own, plans of my own   And I got no coffee break, keeping me awake   All I have to show is bits of give and take   Gonna get on with the night, move on through the sky   We don't have much of anything, but lots of do or die   Every dream that I was sold, since I was a tadpole   Tells me continue in your flight   Every sign that I have seen, I see them whiz by me   Telling me my future isn't bright As of today I've got plans of my own, plans of my own Well I got no time to waste, gotta run post  haste   All I have to show is a smile upon my face   Got a whiskey cured guitar and no place is too far   'Cause I would travel anywhere, to be right where you are   Yes I would travel anywhere, to be right where you are
