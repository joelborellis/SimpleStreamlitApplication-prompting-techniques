 Movin'  Movin' Everybody's movin', movin' across the town The skyline grows and the cut of the clothes Is enough to turn you around Oh, oh the future is just an hour away And the hearts of youth are aflame Everybody's movin', nothing stays the same Fields are turning, the bridges are burning And the light turns night into day It's the time to stake it or make it or break it For the time flies quickly away Oh, oh it's the time to start making your mark And it's the time to get in the game Everybody's movin', nothing stays the same Upwards, outwards, all around They're reaching for the sky The ribbons of highway and roads of steel It's a time to be alive Oh, oh ain't no raging river that we can't cross Nor giant too tall to slain Everybody's movin', nothing stays the same
