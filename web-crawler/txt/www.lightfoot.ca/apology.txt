Apology         I remember everything I've learned about survival I've walked with fools and kings I've even read the bible There I came upon some lines giving me direction Gather not your gold on earth, it will not pass inspection But I chose to live instead inside the shell they gave me Til in spite of everything, good fortune came to find me I tried my best to run away but I could not avoid the feeling Soon I was reeling on my feet I made a grab at anything, the earth was gone And I was on a vicious circle then After I'd gone and let myself surrender I didn't want to die at all, I thought I'd live forever And she gave me everything a king could never borrow But I twisted all her gifts, her wisdom was my sorrow And so I left her crying and roamed across the river The angels offered me their hands, but I could not forget her So I came to where she was, by river, road and reason I slept beneath her window in the moonlight summer season But I could not go inside, I heard the sound of laughter The rustle of her hair upon his skin I made a grab at anything, the earth was gone and I was on a vicious circle then After I'd gone to cry down my sorrow I didn't want to live no more, nor face the bright tomorrow Then I remembered everything I've learned about survival Having walked with fools and kings, I've even read the bible I remember all those lines giving me direction Gather not your gold on earth, it will not pass inspection Still I think when I'm alone, away from all night's splendor If gold could buy one night with her, I wish I had some to send her
