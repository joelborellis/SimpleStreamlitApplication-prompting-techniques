Dreamdrift        I'm like a drifter and I'm drifting along  I might go swifter but the wind is so strong   My body tells me I should let it slow down   Still I keep wishing I was in the next town   In dreams I'm drifting on a sea of dismay You should not meet me when I'm feeling this way I'm still a drifter and I'd like to hold on   I could go swifter but the road is so long            I'm still as crazy as I always have been I could get lazy but my shoes are too thin My radar tells me there's a ghost at my side Still I keep walking and the ghost gets a ride I drift in limbo on a bed of thin air I see a bimbo and there is nobody there I'm still as crazy as I always will be I could get hazy but the road is on me I'm like a drifter just like I always was They call me mister there is no special cause My sister tells me I'm a sight to behold My daughter tells me to come in from the cold I get to heaven and there is no one around You should not meet me when I'm back down on the ground I'm still a drifter but I'd like to hang on I could go swifter but the wind is so strong I drift in limbo on a bed of thin air I see a bimbo and there is nobody there I'm still as crazy as I always have been I could get hazy it's the space I am in
