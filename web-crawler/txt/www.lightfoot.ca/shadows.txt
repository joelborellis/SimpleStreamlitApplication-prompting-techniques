 Shadows  Shadows       Let me reach out love and touch you Let me hold you for awhile I've been all around the world Oh how I long to see you smile There's a shadow on the moon And the waters here below Do not shine the way they should And I love you just in case you didn't know Let it go, let it happen like it happened once before It's a wicked wind and it chills me to the bone And if you do not believe me Come and gaze upon the shadow at your door   Won't you lie down by me baby, run your fingers through my hands I've been all around the town and still I do not understand Is it me or is it you or the shadow of a dream Is it wrong to be in love Could it be the finest love I've ever seen Set it free, let it happen like it happened once before It's a wicked wind and it chills me to the bone And if you do not believe me Come and gaze upon the shadow at your door Please kiss me gently darling where the river runs away From the mountains in the springtime, on a blue and windy day When there's beauty all around, as the shades of night grow deep As the morning stars grow dim They will find us in the shadows fast asleep Let it go, let it happen like it happened once before It's a wicked wind and it chills me to the bone And if you do not believe me Come and gaze upon the shadow at your door
