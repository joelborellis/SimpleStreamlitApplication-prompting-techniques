Triangle Oh the gist of it all is the first day of fall Is the day when my ship will set sail The best of all friends will say good-bye again There's still time for one last glass of ale We'll sail away proudly, our backs to the wall On a southwind and lots of good cheer And when we've looked over the white cliffs of Dover We'll be in Bahama next year From Bermuda on down the Triangle around us Will teach us a lesson or two There's many a mate who unevenly stated The course he had charted was true Don't worry 'bout me, he said "Go down below Give a certified sailor a turn Just sip on your rum or I'll give you my thumb and say, Son you got something to learn" It's a mighty hard way to come down And a mighty fine way to be found So hand me my grip from an old sailing ship Put the kiss of the dawn on my lips With some luck tonight I might have her at my fingertips Oh the best of all things is the first day of spring When when the water runs heavy and fast The mermaids have all gone to Davy Jones' Ball And it seems their first trip was their last They had so much fun they don't wish to return To the beach where they lay all day long They'd rather stay under and boy it's no wonder When all the rock lobsters roll on It's a mighty fine way to be found Triangle Triangle, oh see my ship dangle We're bound for Bahama my friend Like lovers like danger like babies like mangers But that's where my storybook ends Like soldiers of fortune, believers in God And all kings without crosses to bear All sweepers and cleaners with no misdemeanors Should try the triangle out there CHORUS When she took her last tumble the sea bottom rumbled There was no confusion or blame The captain said "Men we must answer again To the sea so ye may not complain" And as they lay sleeping down there in the deep With their faces turned up to the stars A tuna fish turned to a mermaid in bed and said "There goes another sandbar" CHORUS
