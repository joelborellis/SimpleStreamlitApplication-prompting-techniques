 In A Windowpane  In A Windowpane I looked into a windowpane Last evening in a city far away I was feeling sad and blue I wondered then if I should really stay Wanting someone to be with me In the light of this uncertain time Waiting by the window for the man inside To please make up his mind Will you be one who passed through but never saw Never knowing never feeling anything Will you live your whole life through never knowing what to do Will you be one who passed through but never saw I walked along the roadway to a fountain Where lovers come to meet A hobo walked up to me, I could tell He didn't have enough to eat He said, "Good sir you look so kind And though the years have stripped me to the bone It seems I am the better man For in this place I've never walked alone" Will you be one who passed through but never saw Never knowing never feeling anything Will you live your whole life through never knowing what to do Will you be one who passed through but never saw Where will you be, my friendly, when your Telephone ain't giving out no calls And when the seasons come to haunt you Will you still find the springtime in the fall And when you're on your island Will you wave at every ship that passes by And will you feed a hungry man I thank you, sir, now I'll just say goodbye Don't you be one who passed through but never saw Never knowing never feeling anything Will you live your whole life through never knowing what to do Will you be one who passed through but never saw Will you live your whole life through never knowing what to do Will you be one who passed through but never saw
