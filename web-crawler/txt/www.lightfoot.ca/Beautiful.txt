Beautiful       At times I just don't know How you could be anything but beautiful I think that I was made for you and you were made for me And I know that I will never change 'Cause we been friends through rain or shine For such a long, long time Laughing eyes and smiling face, it seems so lucky just to have the right Of telling you with all my might, you're beautiful tonight And I know that you will never stray 'Cause you been that way, from day to day For such a long, long time And when you hold me tight, how could life be anything but beautiful I think that I was made for you and you were made for me And I know that I will never change 'Cause we been friends through rain or shine For such a long, long time And I must say it means so much to me, to be the one That's telling you, I'm telling you, that you're beautiful
