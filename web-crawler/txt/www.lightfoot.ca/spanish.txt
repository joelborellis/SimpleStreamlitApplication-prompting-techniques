 Spanish Moss  Spanish Moss Let go darling, I can feel the night wind call Guess I'd better go I like you more than half as much As I love your Spanish moss Spanish moss a-hanging down Sweeter than the southern love we've found Spanish moss, keeps on following my thoughts around  Georgia pine and ripple wine Memories of Savannah summertime Spanish moss, wish you knew what I was saying So I'm rolling north thinking Of the way things might have been If she and I could have changed it all somehow Spanish moss a-hanging down Lofty as the sycamore you've found Spanish moss, keeps on following my thoughts around Georgia pine and ripple wine Kisses mixed with moonshine and red clay Spanish moss, wish you knew what I was saying So I'm rolling north thinking Of the way things might have been If she and I could have changed it all somehow Let go darling, I can feel the night wind call The devil take the cost I like the way your kisses flow and I love your Spanish moss
