 This Is My Song  This Is My Song       Light of day has come and gone As I sing my weary song Why should you be gone so long I miss you, I miss you, this is my song I've thought and thought and can't conceive Why you made this fool believe That you could never do him wrong I miss you, I miss you, this is my song I feel your touch, I see your face I long to know your warm embrace The night is long, as is my song I'll hum its tune through time and place I wish you knew what I've been through Since you proved to be untrue Love was right, but I was wrong I miss you, I miss you, this is my song I miss you, I miss you, this is my song
