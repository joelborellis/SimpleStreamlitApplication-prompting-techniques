Do You Walk, Do You Talk                    Do you walk, do you talk, do you do funny things Do you run, do you hide, are you gonna survive Do you bike, do you hike, do you like camping out Do you slip, do you slide, do you keep yourself alive There is no situation which can not be overcome There is no fear of loneliness can get me on the run               Do you walk, do you talk, do you live on the block Do you sing, do you play, do you take it away Do you act like a sheep, do you talk in your sleep Do you dance on a dock, do you sit upon a rock There is no situation which can not be addressed There is no kind of common sense which can not be expressed         Are you weak, are you strong, did you ever belong Are you mean, are you lean, have you ever been wrong Are you rough, are you tough or have you had enough Do you stop for a look, do you ever read a book There is no situation which can not be overcome There is no fear of loneliness can get me on the run  Do you walk, do you talk, do you ever get mad Are you first, are you last, do you live in the past Are you tall, are you small, do you stick to the wall Are you cold, are you hot, give it everything you've got There is no situation which can not be addressed  There is no kind of common sense which can not be expressed
