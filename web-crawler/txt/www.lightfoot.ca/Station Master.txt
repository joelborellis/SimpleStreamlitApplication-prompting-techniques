Station Master Â  In the dawn's early light from a long and a sleepless night She returned again this morning from her long and restless flight And my red hollow eyes did not show her much surprise As she lay right down beside me like she never said goodbye Please help me station master, is the evening train on time The well's run dry up yonder, there's another down the line It was all I could bear just to watch her lying there Disowned and ragged princess with the sun locked in her hair So cold, so frail with her mind locked in a jail The victim of confusion, never knowing she could fail Please help me station master, is the evening train on time The well's run dry up yonder, there's another down the line So I rocked her to sleep then I got up on my feet And the day was filled with sunshine as I gazed across the street And the door seemed to say, over here, step this way The station is for travelers, even you must ride someday Please help me station master, is the evening train on time The well's run dry up yonder, there's another down the line Please help me station master can I stay for just a while Forgive me if I'm weary I ain't had much, much time to smile
