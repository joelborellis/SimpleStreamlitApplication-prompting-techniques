 Lifeline  Lifeline             I was in some timeless space, timeless face of my embrace Held empty air and empty space, all on a sunny day She lived by the bounding main, to Baltimore I took a plane An east coast lady lit my flame, all on a sunny day    I was in some dreamless sleep where angels watch as lovers leap Some of them landed on their feet, letting the lifeline stray She was like the breath of spring where flowers grow and robins sing Keeping me from the pouring rain, all on a summer's day There's a lifeline that I know and it holds me back and lets me go Whatever I do I don't let my lifeline stray               So it goes as lifetimes pass from heart to mind and back again My restlessness becomes a flame letting my lifeline show She stood by the boundless tide afraid to ride, afraid to hide Letting her conscience be her guide, needing a lifeline so I was in some aimless state where lovers meet while angels wait With gifts of time they hesitate, all on a sunny day She lived by the bounding main, from Baltimore I took a train An east coast lady lit my flame, all on a summer's day There's a lifeline in my soul and it holds me back and lets me go I'm in love so I've been told, letting the lifeline stay I've got a heartline in the air and if you listen for me you'll find me there Whatever I do I don't let my lifeline stray
