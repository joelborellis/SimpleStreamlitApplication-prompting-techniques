In My Fashion   In my fashion I have been a good man I have loved and I have lost Ever after I will be remembered In my fashion, in my way There have been times, I have seen the reaper In the bad times and the good I have bent down, I have touched the ground Saying prayers and touching wood In my fashion, I have been a father I have loved and been loved in return From the ashes, I have kept the homefires Burning after all was said and done Now take a look at me Do I look like the kind of guy The kind of fool who went to school And had to stand on a stool Because he couldn't come to terms with a slide rule Take a look around again Is it any different now than it was then In my fashion I have been a good man I have loved and I have lost And ever after I will be remembered In my fashion, in my way And ever after I will be remembered In my fashion, in my way
