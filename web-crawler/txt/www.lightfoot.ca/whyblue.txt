 Why Should I Feel Blue    Why Should I Feel Blue       I saw a moonlit scene I never will forget I stole a kiss at daybreak, I never did regret it Sometimes I wonder why I even try So why should I feel blue  I heard the sound of footsteps swaying in the dark I poked my head outside and that's how it started What to my eyes appeared as dust Became a vision I don't know What had finally found me with my back against the wall Was destiny intruding all around me And as the day wore on I knew Another lonely night could never be  If there's a reason you might try and forget I'd like to find it 'cause I'd like to relive it Sometimes I wonder why I ever cry So why should I feel blue I was caught drifting, disappearing from the land Whitecaps in profusion all around me But somehow in your eyes I found The strength to sail upon that raging sea If there's a reason for the way that life is I'd like to find it, after all who's life is it Sometimes I wonder why I even try So why should I feel blue What had finally found me with my back against the wall Was destiny intruding all around me And as the day wore on I knew Another lonely night with you could never be I saw a moonlit scene, I know it was real All that you can ever do with love is reveal it Sometimes I wonder why I even try So why should I feel blue Sometimes I wonder why I ever cry So why should I feel blue
