 My Love For You  My Love For You by Les Pouliot  My love for you is as wild and true as the wind o'er the sea On winter nights so bleak and cold, it always will remain On summer eves, when the breeze whispers your name Like a star of this I'll be singing Oh with you I will spend every evening And my love like the light above shall shine eternally At the end of time, you'll still be mine And I'll be here with thee My love for you is as wild and true as the wind o'er the tide As it travels 'round this whole wide world it gathers seeds of love Through desert sands, through snow and ice and high up above It gathers all the thoughts of lonely couples Until the cup of love overbubbles And with a song it carries on through the skies of blue At the end of time, you'll still be mine and I'll be here with you My love for you is as wild and true as the wind o'er the sea On winter nights so bleak and cold, it always will remain On summer eves, when the breeze whispers your name Like a star of this I'll be singing Oh if you should ever spend every evening And my love like the light above shall shine eternally At the end of time, you'll still be mine and I'll be here with thee
