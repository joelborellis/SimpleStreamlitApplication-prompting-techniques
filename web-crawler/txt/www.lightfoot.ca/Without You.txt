  Without You   If I can last through another sunrise In the past I knew what to do But this was such a grim surprise If I wait for the sun to shine How can I pass the time Without you, without you If I can break the spell that is in me Any fool would no where to go i huess I'd better send a mayday If I find me a rainbow's end How will I find it then Without you, without you Wait till I see you next time Maybe I'll lose my mind Living without you If I can last, wait until the wind dies I've been all up and down like a clown And this is such a thin disguise If I wait for the sun to shine How will I pass the time Without you, without you Wait til I see you next time Maybe I'll lose my mind Living without you Without you, without you Without you, without you
