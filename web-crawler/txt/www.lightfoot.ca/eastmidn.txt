 East Of Midnight  East Of Midnight               Put me somewhere east of midnight, west of the turnpike Anywhere I wander is where I'll take my rest As I lie down, toss some thoughts around Dreams I'm told will come true if you Believe in those who love you right now  Sea of dreams I long for you forget about the others This is my hike, you can come if you like To feel good, I would help you if I could But I am out here searching, for the things that might have been I need no more reminders Not one love letter have I seen And that's a pretty good start The ocean is where lovers meet again Sea of dreams by all means Float me out of danger until then, forever amen It's a long, long hike, we'll be leaving early traveling light That's alright, heaven will be ours tonight The road is paved with moonbeams, there are faces that I knew They all came back to haunt me But that ain't fair to the folks like me and you, it takes a bit of my heart Tonight I shall be watching from the shore Sea of dreams from now on, forget about all the others Back where the line forms, destination sea of storms By all means ever onward sea of dreams Put me somewhere east of midnight, along about daylight Anywhere I wander is where I'll take my rest If we could just lie down love, toss some thoughts around It's a tough and a dirty long hike, you can come if you like If we could just lie down love, toss some thoughts around
