 Peaceful Waters  Peaceful Waters The dead leaves of autumn That cling so desperately Must fly before the cold October winds Their simple life is ended Must they be born to die again Oh may the light of freedom shine For all the world to see And peace and joy to all mankind Through all the years to be For soon the leaves will die And the long hard wind will blow May this world find a resting place Where peaceful waters flow Within my heart there lies a spring Where love and peace abide And from that spring there flows a river fine Through all the countryside But few have drunk therein and why I do not know May this world find a resting place Where peaceful waters flow
