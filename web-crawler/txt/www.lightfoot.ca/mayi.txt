 May I  May I Finders, keepers, losers, weepers Ring around the rosy and I'll catch you if I can And if you don't say may I, then you'll have to start again But first you must indulge me and count from one to ten Let the game begin I adore you when you touch me Pin the tail upon the donkey, you will surely win And if you don't say may I, then I'll pass the cake around And I won't give you any, but you won't make a sound You don't eat soap, anyhow Red light, green light, blue light, yellow light You can take three giant steps or baby step will do But if you don't say may I, then I'll march you out the door Where you'll be contemplating the numbers one to four I hope you're keeping score Cause if you don't say may I, then I'll get you with the hose Spoil your Sunday clothes Will it please you if I tease you While you're at the spin dry, I'll pass the pie around But you won't make a sound You don't eat blackbird anyhow There's four and twenty reasons why it can't be wrong How long have you been gone Finders, keepers, losers, weepers Peter, Peter, pumpkin eater Wear your sneakers around sound sleepers
