Better Off      You believe in all I say Then you throw it all a)way  Before you close the door,   Are you really any better off than before  You go rambling through my day While I'm out here making my way  Still I walk the floor,  Am I really any better off than before  Things never looked so rosy, everything will be okay  I couldn't be much better if I tried    When I get myself to bed With the words that never got said  Turning on the news,  Are we ever any better off when we lose  And we can pick and choose    You had a pathway to my heart, til the cruel world took it apart  Before I close the door, are you really any better off than before  You meander in my dreams, leave me halfway in between  So I hit the floor, am I really any better off than before  Things never looked so rosy, everything will be all right  I couldn't be much better if I tried  You go rambling through my mind, on a path I'm hoping I'll find  Turning on the news, are we ever any better off when we lose  And we can pick and choose             Still I walk the floor,  Are we really any better off than before Better off than before
