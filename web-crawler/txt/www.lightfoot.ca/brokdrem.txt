 Broken Dreams  Broken Dreams             There's an ocean in my mind I'd give the world if I could find A sailing ship and leave the past behind  Now that I must say adieu It's killing me, I'm telling you When freedom calls what can a person do  I have felt the winds of change Go stealing through my heart and soul How wild it seems In love songs and in nursery rhymes On movie screens, in fairy tales Lie broken dreams Life's broken dreams, love's broken dreams Sometimes a broken dream Will make you sad or make you mean Sometimes things ain't as bad as they might seem You might walk a lonely street Until one day you chance to meet A stranger who might ask where have you been You will see the light of change Come shining through your windowpane When hope is gone Though money, fame, and riches are For fools and kings or anything that turns them on Life's broken deals, life's spinning wheels There's an ocean I have found I'd like to sail the world around And dream about the life I hope I'll find Now that I must say adieu To love's returns, I'm telling you When freedom comes what can a person do I have felt the winds of change Go stealing through my heart and soul How wild they seem In sounds of spring, in winter storms In autumn gales, on summer morns lie broken dreams In love songs and in nursery rhymes On movie screens, in fairy tales Lie broken dreams, life's broken dreams, love's broken dreams
