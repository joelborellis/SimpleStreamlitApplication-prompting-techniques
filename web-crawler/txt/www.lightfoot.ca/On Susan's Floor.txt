On Susan's Floor by Shel Silverstein and Vince Matthews Like crippled ships that made it Through a storm and finally reached a quiet shore The homeless found a home on Susan's floor Didn't feel so cold and tired Stretched out before her fire Rolling smokes and drinking up her wine And I remember candlelight And singing til we could not sing no more Then falling warm asleep on Susan's floor Well now that my song is sweeeter I think I'd like to greet her And thank her for the favors that she gave A stranger I came My head bowed in the rain to her door I sat and sang my songs on Susan's floor In the morning I'd go on Buying kingdoms with my songs    Knowing I'd be back in just a while Warming in the sunlight of her smile    Well lots of time and songs have passed I catch myself just looking back Reliving all the wonder of those nights That's where I'd be today If I had only stayed one night more And sang another song on Susan's floor Like crippled ships that made it Through a storm and finally reached a quiet shore The homeless found a home on Susan's floor
