 Race Among The Ruins  Race Among The Ruins         You think you had the last laugh Now you know this can't be true Even though the sun shines down upon you now Some times you must feel blue You make the best of each new day You try not to be sad Even though the sky falls down upon you Call it midnight feeling bad When you wake up to the promise Of your dream world coming true With one less friend to call on Was it someone that I knew Away you will go sailing In a race among the ruins If you plan to face tomorrow, do it soon The road to love is littered By the bones of other ones Who by the magic of the moment Were mysteriously undone You try to understand it But you never seem to find Any kind of freedom, coming clean Is just another state of mind So take the best of all that's left You know this cannot last Even though your mother was you maker From her apron strings you pass Just think about the fool Who by his virtue can be found In a most unusual situation Playing jester to the clown
