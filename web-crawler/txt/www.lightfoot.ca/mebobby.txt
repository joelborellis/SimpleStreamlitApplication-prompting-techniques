 Me And Bobby McGee  Me And Bobby McGee by Kris Kristofferson / Fred Foster Busted flat in Baton Rouge, heading for the train Feeling nearly faded as my jeans Bobby thumbed a diesel down, just before it rained Took us all away to New Orleans I took my harpoon out of my dirty red bandana And was blowing sad while Bobby sang the blues With those windshield wipers slapping time And Bobby clapping hands we finally Sung up every song that driver knew Freedom's just another word, for nothing left to lose Nothing ain't worth nothing but it's free Feeling good was easy Lord when Bobby sang the blues Feeling good was good enough for me Good enough for me and Bobby McGee From the coal mines of Kentucky to the California sun Bobby shared the secrets of my soul Standing right beside me Lord through every thing I done Every night she kept me from the cold Then somewhere near Salinas Lord I let her slip away Searching for the home I heard she owned And I'd give all my tomorrows for a single yesterday Holding Bobby's body close to mine Freedom's just another word, for nothing left to lose Nothing ain't worth nothing but it's free Feeling good was easy Lord when Bobby sang the blues Feeling good was good enough for me Good enough for me and Bobby McGee
