 Don't Beat Me Down  Don't Beat Me Down               When he was a man, my father would stand I never saw him run There wasn't anyone could make the man bend And the strength of his will was the tool of his trade And he did his work well Til the powers that be took a liking to him And they traded his body for a cold empty shell Don't beat me down,   Don't beat me down,   I've got something to say, don't you stand in my way And don't beat me down   When I was a youth, I found the truth in the eyes of a friend There wasn't anyone could make the light dim And we talked and we rambled and we gambled to win And the learning was good, til the powers that be to a liking to him And they traded their fortunes for the sight of his blood When I was a child my mother smiled at the cradle she bought For the little tot she held to her breast And the song that she sang was an anthem to love It was all that I heard, til the powers that be took a liking to me And they told me that love was a four-letter word Don't beat me down, don't beat me down I've got one life to live and that's all I can give, so don't beat me down Now I've got a place, got a worried face and the question in mind Please let me find a reason somehow While some reap the harvest while other men die And the joker runs wild and if powers that be take a liking to us Then we all must return to the ways of a child We all must return to the ways of a child So don't beat me down, don't beat me down I've got something to say, don't you stand in my way and don't beat me down I've got one life to life and that's all I can give So don't beat me down, don't beat me down, don't beat me down
