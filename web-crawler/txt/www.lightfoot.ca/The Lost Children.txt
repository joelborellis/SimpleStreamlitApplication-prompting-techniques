The Lost Children           Down the hall their voices ring, their feet are on the run Phantoms on a winter sky, together they do come Faded lips and eyes of blue, they're carried in the wind Their laughter filled the countryside but they'll not laugh again All their games are ended now, their voices have been stilled Their fathers built the tools of war by which they all were killed Their mothers made the uniforms showing which side they were on And the young boys were the middle men for the guns to prey upon You've seen the fires in the night, watched the devil as he smiled You've heard a mothers mournful cry as she searches for her child You've seen the lines of refugees, the faces of despair And wondered at the wise men who never seem to care Goodbye you lost children, God speed you on your way Your little beds are empty now, your toys are put away Your mother sings a lullaby as she gazes at the floor Your father builds more weapons and marches out once more Down the hall their voices ring, their feet are on the run Phantoms on a winter sky, together they do come Faded lips and eyes of blue, they're carried in the wind Their laughter filled the countryside but they'll not laugh again
