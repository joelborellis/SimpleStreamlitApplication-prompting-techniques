 Ordinary Man  Ordinary Man         Try to understand I'm not your ordinary man, still I can't deny You go with me everywhere When I'm dreaming you still share my lonely nights  Try to see my side It's not your ordinary pride that keeps driving me on It's that lonesome, restless feeling that you feel under the gun And it leads me to the highway but it keeps my body warm  And as I wander to the cities and the towns I get so lonesome knowing you could be around And when the show is over, there's a holiday motel Another empty bottle and another tale to tell Try to comprehend I'm not your ordinary friend at the end of my life I would pray that I could be Returning to the shelter of your love Try to see my side It's not your ordinary pride that keeps driving me on It's that lonesome, restless feeling that you feel under the gun And it leads me to the highway but it keeps my body warm And as I wander to the cities and the towns I get so lonesome knowing you could be around And when the show is over, there's a holiday motel Another empty bottle and another tale to tell Try to understand I'm not your ordinary man, still I can't deny You go with me everywhere Like a shadow in the gloom I remember all the good times There's a ghost in every room
