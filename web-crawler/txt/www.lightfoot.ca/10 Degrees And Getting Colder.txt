10 Degrees And Getting Colder He was standing by the highway, with a sign that just said "Mother" When he heard a driver coming, about a half a mile away Then he held the sign up higher so no decent soul could miss it It was ten degrees or colder down by Boulder dam that day He was raised up in Milwaukee, though he never was that famous He was just a road musician to the taverns he would go Singing songs about the rambling, the loving girls and gambling How the world fell on his shoulders back in Boulder I don't know It was out in Arizona that he heard the lady listening To each word that he was saying, to each line that he would write So he sat down by her table and they talked about the weather Ninety-eight point six and rising down by Boulder dam that night And she told him she would take him For a ride in the morning sun Back in Boulder he had told her I don't know when I had a better friend Now he's traded off his Martin but his troubles are not over For his feet are almost frozen and the sun is sinking low Won't you listen to me brother, if you ever loved your mother Please pull off on the shoulder if you're going Milwaukee way It's ten degrees and getting colder down by Boulder dam today
