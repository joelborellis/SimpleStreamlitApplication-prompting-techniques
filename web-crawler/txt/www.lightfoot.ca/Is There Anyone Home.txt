Is There Anyone Home       Is there anyone home in this house made of stone Anyone inside know my name I've been around for a half a hundred days Never saw a door shut so tight Turn around, don't look down There's a man behind you with a gun  Like any wandering child in the wilderness Wild and uncaged on your wings I think I heard, someone stir I think I heard, someone stir There's a light around you, I've come to switch it on It will brighten every room Don't be ashamed if you feel A whole lot warmer in you heart  You got that feeling in your soul  Is there anyone home in this house made of stone Anyone in there who might care I've grown weary and wise and I feel much amazed Got a few good tales to unwind Turn around, don't look down There's a man behind you with a gun Like any wandering minstrel at dawn In the house of a thousand delights I think I heard, someone stir
