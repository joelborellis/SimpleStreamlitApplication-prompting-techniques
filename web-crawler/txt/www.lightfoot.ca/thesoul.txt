 The Soul Is The Rock  The Soul Is The Rock           The soul is the rock and the rock will not be moved  Nothing is disputed, yet nothing is disproved And the seeds of the earth that were planted long ago Still yield a better harvest than the rock was prone to grow Say what you like to do what you do, everyone's sleeping now two by two Bats in the roof, cats in the hall, dust on the stairway, gnats on the wall Big rain coming, big rain coming this way Rain on the rock, rain on the rock, rain on the rock The sea is the space which the rock has displaced The mind is some stranger that some soul has embraced And somewhere between, in a no-man's land of dreams The heart becomes the soldier yet the rock is not redeemed Say what you like to do what you can, live like a sheep, die like a lamb Bats in the roof, cats in the hall, dust on the stairway, gnats on the wall Big rain coming, big rain coming this way Rain on the rock, rain on the rock, rain on the rock The soul is the rock and the rock will always roll In circles 'round the sun doing rings around the pole When the mind is not sure what the heart will do next The rock becomes the master and the road becomes what's left Late one night when the moon shone down, we went to the mill on the edge of the town She wore white, I wore black, the town was sleeping when we got back Big rain coming, big rain coming this way Rain on the rock, rain on the rock, rain on the rock The soul is the rock and the rock will not be harmed Though man must be cheated just as woman must be charmed And the mind is the light for the heart which cannot see The soul becomes the stranger but the rock will always be Say what you like to do what you do, everyone's sleeping now two by two Bats in the roof, cats in the hall, dust on the stairway, gnats on the wall Big rain coming, big rain coming this way Rain on the rock, rain on the rock, rain on the rock, rain on the rock (Repeat 1st Verse) And the seeds of the earth that were planted long ago Still yield a better harvest than the rock was prone to grow
