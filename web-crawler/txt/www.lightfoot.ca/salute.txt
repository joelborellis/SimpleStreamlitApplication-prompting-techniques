 Salute  Salute         Listen mister I won't waste your time I hope all the mistakes you made were a lot like mine Loving girls too much sometimes they made you cry Maybe we've got more living to do with a lot less pain Here let's drink to you These are the words I knew would break the ice I held my hand out and he shook it twice It seemed to me like I'd been here before Deja vu, familiar voice And the salute of my choice Salute gentlemen of days gone by Ladies of leisure and of flashing eye May some romantic fool turn on your light As for me I'm in between, all that I can do is dream You got a lot more living to do And a lot more loving too When you make it through the night with no end in sight And the dawn peeks through  You got a lot more living to do Salute nightingales upon the tide Brothers of the cloth tonight who must be tried May all of your martinis be forever dry As for me I'm in between, all that I can do is dream You got a lot more living to do and a lot more loving too When you make it through the night with no end in sight And the dawn peeks through You got a lot more living to do and a lot more loving too You got a lot more living to do and a lot more loving too
