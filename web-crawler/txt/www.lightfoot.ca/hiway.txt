 Hi'Way Songs  Hi' Way Songs         When I walk the hills so high around the town where I was born New York seems so far away though I was there just yesterday I have played on my guitar in coffeehouses, halls and bars Everyone that I call friend knows they will not be forgot Trains and planes and rented cars, singers, saints, and other stars I suspect them everyone, they'll never change it's too much fun Just for now I'd like to rest in the shade of a maple tree To the blue Canadian sky I'll say a prayer for the world out there  When I stand on my own sod it feels so good to be home, by God The winter wind has turned my head but I always came up warm somehow Bottles, beads, and cigarettes and lovers that I ain't found yet Picking with a friend til dawn, singing all those hi'way songs Just for now I'd like to rest in the shade of a maple tree To the blue Canadian sky I'll say a prayer for the world out there When I walk the hills so high around the town where I was born New York seems so far away though I was there just yesterday I would travel all my life if loneliness was not the price Heading north across that line's the only time I'm flying
