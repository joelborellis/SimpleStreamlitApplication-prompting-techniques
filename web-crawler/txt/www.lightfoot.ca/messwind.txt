 Message To The Wind  A Message To The Wind Hold my hand, so I can hold you in my heart Hold my hand, so I can guide you through the forest of the night By the sea upon the raging tide A message through the wind, I must begin to write of love and rain Touch my heart, for it is beating just for you Hear my song, as I sing it to the lost and lonely ones If there were time to spend another day A message to the wind, I would begin if he could blow my thoughts to you Hold my hand, now it s time for me to go Take my love and let it rest for we must meet again somehow When you're alone and willows start to bend And rain begins to fall at times you will pretend And not pretend at all, I'll be with you again A message to the wind
