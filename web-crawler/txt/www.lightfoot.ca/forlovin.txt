 For Lovin' Me  For Lovin' Me             That's what you get for lovin' me   That's what you get for lovin' me  Everything you had is gone As you can see That's what you get for lovin' me I ain't the kind to hang around With any new love that I found 'Cause moving is my stock in trade I'm moving on I won't think of you when I'm gone So don't you shed a tear for me 'Cause I ain't the love you thought I'd be I got a hundred more like you So don't be blue I'll have a thousand 'fore I'm through Now there you go you're crying again Now there you go you're crying again But then someday when your poor heart Is on the mend I just might pass this way again (Repeat 1st verse)
