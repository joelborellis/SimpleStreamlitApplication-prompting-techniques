Endless Wire Â  I ain't got nothing to hide My mind is an endless wire I got both feet on the ground I don't have no one for hire I ain't got a thing to show My lives have all expired So don't go fooling around And set my wheels afire Down in the dark of a burnt out soul There's a few good second hand dreams Deep in the dark of a heavenly night with you  Down in the black of a bottomless hole There's a few good second hand scenes Deep in the dark of a heavenly blue Where the sea runs green  I ain't got nothing to give My life is an endless climb My love's a paperback dream I don't have nothing but time I ain't got a thing to show I don't know my own name So don't go fooling around And set my wheels aflame Down in the dark of a beat out soul There's a few good second hand dreams Deep in the dark of a heavenly night with you Down in the black of a bottomless hole There's a few good second hand scenes Deep in the dark of a heavenly blue Where the sea runs green I ain't got nothing to hide My mind is an endless wire I got both feet on the ground I don't have no one for hire I ain't got a thing to show My life is an endless climb My love's a paperback dream I don't have nothing but time
