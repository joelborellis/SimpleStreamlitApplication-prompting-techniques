My Little Love           I got a song that is on my mind My little love who is never unkind  I'm a poet and I'm better off dead, these are the words she said  Down by the breadline picking up dough Hand me the guitar, there I'll go  I would rather make a living instead, instead of being in the red  My little love from the world outside Helping me keep, turning the tide  Come and meet me by the neon light And I'm hoping you will make it allright      I'll do anything you see fit, my little love         My little love moving in my soul, my little love who will never turn cold It doesn't matter if I ain't shaved, it doesn't matter if I ain't behaved My little love you been on my side, helping me keep, turning the tide Have a hard time living right now, having a fine time showing you how My little love from the world out there, helping me keep adoing my share Come and meet me by the neon light, and I'm hoping you will make it allright I'll do anything you see fit, my little love My little love you been on my mind, my little love who is never unkind I'm a poet and I'm better off dead, these are the words she said Down by the breadline picking up dough, hand me the guitar, there I'll go It doesn't matter if I ain't shaved, or it don't matter if I ain't behaved I got a light that is in my soul, I got a love that'll never turn cold Come and meet me by the neon tonight, and I'm hoping you will make it allright I'll do anything you see fit, my little love I'll do anything you see fit, my little love
