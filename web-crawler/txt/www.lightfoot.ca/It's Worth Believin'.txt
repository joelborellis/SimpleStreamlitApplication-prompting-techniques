It's Worth Believin' There's a warm wind tonight And the moon turns the tide When the stars take their ride she'll be leaving Where she goes, I don't know She won't tell me what it is That makes her act like this But I've got a funny feeling that it's me It's worth believing Should I ask Do you like to go walking on the sand Listen to the sea Or could it be someone kind Could it be that I'm the fool There's something wrong with you And I've got a funny feeling that it's me It's worth believing  La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la There's a breeze from the shore and the waves overlap When I've called in the cat she'll go walking And she cries to herself in the night when I'm asleep She lies awake and weeps Could it be, someone new, someone old who has returned Or is it just a game But I've got a funny feeling that it's me, it's worth believing There's a warm wind tonight and the moon turns the tide When the stars take their ride she'll be leaving Where she goes, I don't know She won't tell me what it is makes her act like this Should I ask, do you like to go walking on the shore Listen to the sea, could it be, someone kind Could it be that I'm the fool, there's something wrong with you And I've got a funny feeling that it's me, it's worth believing
