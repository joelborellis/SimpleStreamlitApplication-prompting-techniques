  All The Lovely Ladies               All the lovely ladies in their finery tonight I wish that I could know them one by one All the handsome gentlemen with loving on their minds Strolling in to take the ladies home Bless you all and keep you on the road to tenderness Heaven can be yours just for now All the gentle strangers who by nature do not smile To everyone who cannot hold a pen   All you heavy rounders with a headache for your pains Who dread the thought of going around the bend Bless you all and keep you on the road to better things Heaven can be yours just for now To all the lovely ladies in their finery tonight I wish that I could kiss you while you knit To all the ones who learn to live with being second-guessed Whose job it is to give more than they get Bless you all and keep you with the strength to understand Heaven can be yours just for now All the little dreamers with a dream that cannot last To all the sleeping giants who must wake To every man who answers to the letter of the law And all the rest in prison by mistake Bless you all and keep you with the faith to let it pass Heaven can be yours just for now All the lonely sailors who have trouble being seen To each of you with heartache that remains Maybe sometime later you might swim back into shore If someone could relieve you of your chains Bless you all and keep you all on the land or on the sea Heaven can be yours just for now
