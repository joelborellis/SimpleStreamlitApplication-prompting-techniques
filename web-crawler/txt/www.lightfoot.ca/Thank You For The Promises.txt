Thank You For The Promises Â  Thank you for the promises we make I know I can't complain, I think I did alright No failures are in sight, only now and then I'd like to reminisce, do you remember when Even if we're angels we can't ask To wander through the past, the future is our goal The night is black as coal, if I could pay the price I'd like to love you once, I'd love to love you twice Thanks, we cannot say enough, the road is sometimes rough But we can get along The going will get tough, but we won't be afraid Of the promises we made Thank you for the promises you keep When I am fast asleep, to be where we belong Is all that I can ask, we can do it in the shade As long as I have you and the promises we made Thank you for the promises we break If you made a clean mistake, well that's what love's about No need to stand and shout, the truth is in your eyes The answer lies within, no need to criticize Thanks, for the promises at hand, the abuse that we must stand Is often heaven sent They may not pay the rent, you never can be sure When promises get bent Thank you for the promises that live That is all that I can give, forever in my mind To leave the past behind and seal it with a kiss Forever in my soul, I will remember this
