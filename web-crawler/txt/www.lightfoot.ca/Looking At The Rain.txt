  Looking At The Rain         Looking at the rain, feeling the pain Of love lost running through, my brain Looking at the wind, watching it spin The leaves along the street, you win Waiting for a line to fall Telling you it's all a big mistake Looking at a face, so out of place Inside that picture frame, of lace Looking at the wall, wishing you'd call And tell me you're okay, that's all Wishing this was all a dream And I'd find you sleeping when I wake Looking at the trees, so ill at ease From sleep that will not come, that's me Looking at the dawn, knowing it's wrong Still thinking of your love, that's gone Wishing this was all a dream And I'd find you sleeping when I wake Looking at the rain, feeling the pain Of love lost running through, my brain Looking at the wind, watching it spin The leaves along the street, you win Waiting for a line to fall Telling you it's all a big mistake But the words won't come, I know I'd feel the same Looking at the rain
