Knotty Pine She's my knotty pine, she leans with the wind She cries turpentine Sometimes she nettles me but I don't mind Only now and then, when her branches bend beneath the snow She's knotty but nice, reaching for the sky She don't like snow or ice To leave things as they stand is my advice She's been good to me, so I tend to go there when I can   She's my knotty pine, such a pretty scene She tries to be kind She gives birds a home and shelters them In her coat of green, she's as green as evergreen can be She's a real delight, when little breezes call To ruffle up her skin, all her sap runs free and sticks to me Hidden deep within, I will be her slave eternally   She's my knotty pine, sunlight in her hair By the serpentine Though she is independent I don't mind Standing over there, just beyond that maple on the right She's knotty but wise, she holds her anger in Trees are her disguise Cones are taking root before my eyes Find them if you can, among her boughs she keeps them out of sight She's my knotty pine, she leans with the wind She crys turpentine Sometimes she nettles me but I don't mind Only now and then, when her branches bend beneath the snow
