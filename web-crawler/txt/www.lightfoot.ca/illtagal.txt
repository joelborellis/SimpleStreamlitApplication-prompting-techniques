 I'll Tag Along  I'll Tag Along           You've got time enough for two of us What is mine I will share  We've got things that we can do without Most anytime anywhere  Every little daydream that appears in all we do Gives us some problems of our own  If you turn back to that page again And you can't win If you ask me I'll tag along   Paper matches in the afternoon Cups of tea and all of that Zen I think it's time we took a walk outside It seems there is no oxygen This time tomorrow we might all be packed and gone I believe it's best we carry on Smoke rings rising til they disappear In the sky above If you ask me I'll tag along Each and every bad dream will be hammered into dust When we get back where we belong If you ever turn that page again And you need a friend If you ask me I'll tag along This time tomorrow we might all be packed and gone I believe it's best we carry on Smoke rings rising till they disappear In the sky above If you ask me I'll tag along
