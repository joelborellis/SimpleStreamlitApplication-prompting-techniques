 Make Way For The Lady  Make Way For The Lady Some life I've been living, like a song in the night Good sounds every moment, good news and bright lights Anytime I get lonesome, I just got to do the things right Make way for the lady, you can do it my son Making hay with no gravy, brings the good folk down Anytime you get lonely, you just got to turn it around       This life I've been given, it don't tell you no lies Could've been somewhat wasted, how could it be otherwise When the sound of the laughter brought the tears in to my eyes Make way for the lady, you can do it my son Making hay with no gravy, gets the day's work done When a blue mood gets rolling, you just got to turn it around Turn it around   Shake hands with the father, the son and the holy ghost The impossible believers and the heavenly host If you must do it better, you just got to do it the most Make way for the lady, you can do it my son Making hay with no gravy, brings all the good folk down When a blue moon starts rising, you just got to turn it around Turn it around,  turn it around  Make way for the lady and turn it around
