 I Used To Be A Country Singer  I Used To Be A Country Singer by Steve McEown       I was sitting in my hotel room, strumming my old guitar Not much to do when you're far away, playing some smokey bar I was feeling a little empty and feeling a little blue When the maid came in and asked me if she could do my room I put down my old guitar and she gave me a smile She had a crusty voice and a drinker's look But she had a friendly style She dusted my room and made my bed and she talked of days gone by She spoke of when she wooed the men, a tear came to her eye And she said, "I used to be a country singer I could sing a mean Patsy Cline My husband he could yodel like Wilf Carter Kitty Wells was a real good friend of mine" She told me that her husband died and her son was overseas I could tell by her eyes and her broken smile she was lonely just like me She asked me if I'd listen to a tape of when she was young She said, "I can't sing now, I forget the words and my voice is almost gone" And she said, "I used to be a country singer I could sing a mean Patsy Cline My husband he could yodel like Wilf Carter Kitty Wells was a real good friend of mine" Oh I cried inside but I couldn't tell if it was for her or for me So I grabbed my axe and we sang a song in two part harmony Ever since that day when I'm feeling down and I can't find a happy tune I just think of that maid and the feeling she gave when she came to clean my room And she said, "I used to be a country singer I could sing a mean Patsy Cline My husband he could yodel like Wilf Carter Kitty Wells was a real good friend of mine" Kitty Wells was a real good friend of mine  Kitty Wells was a real good friend of mine
