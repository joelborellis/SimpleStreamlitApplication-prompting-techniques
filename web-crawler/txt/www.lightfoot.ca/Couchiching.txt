Couchiching There's a town they call Orillia, it is there of which I sing It is just above Lake Simcoe, by Lake Couchiching Couchiching, Couchiching, by Lake Couchiching Cououchiching, by Lake Couchiching Couchiching, Couchiching, by Lake Couchiching Couchiching Across the raging Narrows, Casino Rama stands Where there once were only sparrows, people come from other lands To the west lie hills aplenty, if skiing is your thing You can while away the summer, by Lake Couchiching CHORUS In Orillia they had movies and sports and music too And all around the shoreline were the folks that we all knew CHORUS Now I've spent my life in travel, now I've spent my life in dust Now I've spent my life in family, now I've spent my life in trust Any way you'd like to cut it, it'll hit you with a ping When you think about Orillia and it's by Lake Couchiching CHORUS When I get my final slumber, when I pawn my diamond ring I will do my final number, by Lake Couchiching
