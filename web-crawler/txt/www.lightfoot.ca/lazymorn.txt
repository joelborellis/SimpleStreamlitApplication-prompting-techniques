 Lazy Mornin'  Lazy Mornin' Another lazy mornin', no need to get down on anyone My son, coffee's in the kitchen, woman on the run No need to get bothered I'll think about Monday when Monday comes It's two for one, mister hoot 'n holler Got to make a dollar Another lazy mornin', I took time to make town and stock a pint or two The most delicious brew, keeping up with the Joneses I hope no one telephones us I'd take a place in the country But for now the old back yard Looks to me like fifty acres Of the roundest ground in town Another lazy mornin', come suppertime I'm gonna light my barbecue Nothin' new, only that she loves me and nothing I know can change me No need to get bothered, I do more living than it might seem Some dream, living like a pauper, bless my darling daughter I'd like to know what makes a man go Over land and sea I guess it must get kind of lonesome That's the way I used to be Another lazy mornin', no need to get down on anyone Such fun, coffee's in the kitchen, woman on the run
