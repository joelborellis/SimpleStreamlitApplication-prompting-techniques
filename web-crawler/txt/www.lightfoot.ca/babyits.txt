 Baby It's Alright  Baby It's Allright It's all right, baby it's all right, it's all right, baby it's all right, Anything you say gonna be okay, 'cause it's all right, baby it's all right Open the door love let your light shine in The morning comes too quickly it will not come again I'll take you at your promise I will not ask you why I only wish to love you until the day I die It's a shame, baby it's a shame, when you play your hurtin' game Every single day, every single night, but that's okay, baby it's allright Open the door love the sun lights up the gloom I know you been out walking, I will not ask with whom The night will soon be over, the sky is almost grey Your hair is all a-tangle, your thoughts are all astray It's all right, baby it's all right, it's all right, baby it's all right, Anything you say gonna be okay, 'cause it's all right, baby it's all right Open the door love let your light shine in Staying here is foolish to leave would be a sin I know I'm close behind you I'll catch you if I try For I must surely win you or I will surely die It's a shame, baby it's a shame, when you play your hurtin' game Every single day, every single night, but that's okay, baby it's all right
