Farewell To Annabel             Where did you go when the snow lay on the ground What did you do when the rain began to fall How did it feel when I looked through your soul When was the last time you wanted my love  How many nights did you cry your dreams to sleep Why did you hide what knew would not stay hidden How could you put yourself through like you did I'm not the kind that would hold you that way Drop me a line if you wake up feeling bad I'm still a friend and I'd like to hear from you Where does it say love should last forever When was the last time I told that to you Farewell to Annabel, farewell Farewell to Annabel, farewell Farewell to Annabel, fare thee well Farewell to Annabel, farewell
