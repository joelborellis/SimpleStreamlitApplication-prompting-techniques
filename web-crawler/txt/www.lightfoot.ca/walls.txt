 Walls  Â  Walls I'm not ashamed to say that I've loved you well I'm not ashamed to let you know I'm just a name that's all, scratched upon your wall You used it well but what the hell That's what walls are for I'm not ashamed to listen to the fast falling rain In the morning upon my window I'm not afraid to cry, I'm not ashamed to try To be your friend once again That's what's friends are for Friends are for sorting out the hangups that we hide Walls are for shutting out the love we feel inside I'm not ashamed, no, to talk it over once again To rearrange my vocabulary But I can't seem to find, any words to change your mind Because I left them all behind And that's what words are for Words are for explaining the mistakes we might have made Names are for calling when there's nothing left to say I'm not ashamed, no, to say I've loved you well I'm not ashamed, and yet I know I'm just a name, that's all, scratched upon your wall You used it well, but what the hell That's what walls are for I'm not ashamed of wearing out my old grey socks Chasing you around the back woods I'm not ashamed to darn nor to proud to find some yarn To sew them up once again 'Cause that's what socks are for
