  Uncle Toad Said               Uncle Toad sitting by the old south gate Waiting them boys they been staying out late Uncle Toad thinks they are way out of line Maybe they think he is past his prime  Uncle Toad said, "Better straighten up right" When Uncle Toad spoke it was not a pretty sight  Uncle Toad lived in the wood out back Lived in the shade of a utility shack He looked in at the big brick house At the girls as quiet as a mouse Uncle Toad said, "You had best get it right" When Uncle Toad spoke it was not a pretty sight Uncle Toad tucked in the compost pile Out by the back door look at him smile He said, "Kid stop drinking that brew Plan while you can or the joke's on you" Uncle Toad said, "Better straighten up right" When Uncle Toad spoke it was not a pretty sight Uncle Toad sitting by the swimming pool Sits in the sun when the weather turns cool Sits in the sun when the girls walk by Maybe they think he's a little bit sly Uncle Toad said, "You had best get it right" When Uncle Toad spoke it was not a pretty sight Uncle Toad sitting by the cool mill race All day long with a grin on his face He said, "Boys you had better not try Kissin'em girls 'cause I won't stand by Uncle Toad said, "Better straighten up right" When Uncle Toad spoke it was not a pretty sight Uncle Toad sitting by the wrought iron fence Looks at the moon like it don't make sense We say, "Toad here's looking at you Hoping you'll get your wish too" Sway to the left, sway to the right When Uncle Toad spoke it was not a pretty sight
