Blackberry Wine         There's a south wind rising and the moon shines on my window sill I've got a feeling I might walk on over the hill I'm bent but not broken, all I need is some rest And a bottle of your very best, Blackberry wine There's a new moon rising and the wind sings its old song Pass it on over it's a sin to be sober too long I'm bent but not broken, all I need is my share Of a bottle of that very rare, Blackberry wine Blackberry wine You know that I'm no good without you Blackberry wine My old gal's got a new dress on five and dime Try as she will she can't get me to come home on time But I'd never cheat her or mistreat her you know As over the mountain I go, Blackberry wine I'll be soft spoken, all I need is my rest And a bottle of your very best, Blackberry wine Now my days are numbered and one more heel's been killed Blackberry John left me his old recipe in his will I'm bent but not broken, all I need is some time And a bottle of your very fine, Blackberry wine Blackberry wine You know that I'm quite dry without you Blackberry wine
