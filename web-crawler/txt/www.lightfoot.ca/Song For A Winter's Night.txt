Song For A Winter's Night The lamp is burning low upon my table top The snow is softly falling The air is still in the silence of my room I hear your voice softly calling If I could only have you near To breathe a sigh or two  I would be happy just to hold the hands I love On this winter night with you The smoke is rising in the shadows overhead My glass is almost empty I read again between the lines upon each page The words of love you sent me If I could know within my heart, that you were lonely too I would be happy just to hold the hands I love Upon this winter night with you The fire is dying now, my lamp is growing dim The shades of night are lifting The morning light steals across my windowpane Where webs of snow are drifting If I could only have you near, to breathe a sigh or two I would be happy just to hold the hands I love Upon this winter night with you And to be once again with you
