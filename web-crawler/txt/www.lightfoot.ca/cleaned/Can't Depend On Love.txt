Can't Depend On Love I spent most of my life outside in the driving rain I was only trying to get by with some of life's amenities Well nothing's free I got more than I bargained for, now it's plain to see I can't depend on love to defend me It took most of my time to do what never was done I was on the outside of an inside kind of love that now is gone Come right or wrong It was laid to rest that way, I hate to be unkind Pretending is for strangers who don't know you I spent most of my life outside in the driving rain I was in some one-horse town just waiting for a plane to take me back Now where's that at I paid the price, well ain't that nice, knowing I'm so free I can't depend on love to defend me I got more than I bargained for, now it's plain to see I can't depend on love to defend me
