Oh So Sweet It's so easy to live with no fear or deceit But sometimes I think maybe I have skipped a beat The road I chose was not all it should be But sometimes it was oh so sweet Sometimes I remember hearing raindrops fall Feeling my love breathing alongside of me It ain't easy to live with no tears of regret But sometimes it was oh so sweet There's a room in my soul where old hearts are at rest The mention of which breeds only an empty nest Go with the flow where society heels But sometimes it was oh so sweet Kneeling in my dream world, ear close to the ground I can hear the rumble of the things I love It ain't easy to grieve over things said and done But sometimes life was oh so sweet Oh the less we believe in the less we belong Let's all gather 'round so that we can carry on Stick to the mainstream and we'll be okay But sometimes it was oh so sweet Sometimes I remember seeing starlight fade Back when life was still only a mystery Was it good, was it bad or the best you ever had But sometimes it was oh so sweet
