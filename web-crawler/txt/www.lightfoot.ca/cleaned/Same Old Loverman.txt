Same Old Loverman I'm not some long lost someone Just dropped in to say hello It's that same old loverman Baby you lost so long ago 'Cause I was born to believe I never could deceive, believe me I hear no children's voices Have they gone back to school And that same old loverman Is still acting like some kind of fool I guess I was born to bring you grief Though I never was a thief, believe me It's cold outside your window Please let me in, the night is wild It's that same old loverman Not some lonesome winsome child And I was born to believe I never could deceive
