The Watchman's Gone Just like birds of a feather We two have followed the golden sun It feels so good, knowing the watchman's gone If I give you a rose, buddy Would you please bury it in the field I seen a rose, watching it all fold out There's a train down at the station It's come to carry my bones away Two engines on, twenty-one coaches long End to end, twenty-one coaches thin The watchman's out, kicking the bums about If I wait for the right moment You can bet I'll climb aboard unseen I've done it before, I know I can do it in my sleep The watchman's out, kicking the bums about The watchman's out, kicking your dreams about As I leave you in the sunset Got one more nothin' I'd like to say You don't owe me, a son of the sea am I This I say to you my brother If you live to follow the golden sun You better beware, knowing the watchman's always there If you find me feeding daisies Please turn my face up to the sky And leave me be, watching the moon roll by Whatever I was, you know it was all because I been on the town, washing the bullshit down The watchman's out, kicking your dreams about It feels so good, knowing the watchman's gone It's like a song, knowing the watchman's gone
