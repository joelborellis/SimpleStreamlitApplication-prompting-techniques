Summertime Dream Where the road runs down by the butternut grove To old Bill Skinner's stream Do tell at the noonday bell It's time for a summertime dream In a lunch pail town in a one horse way You can live like a king and queen Let's steal away in the noonday sun It's time for a summertime dream Birds in all creation will be twittering in the trees And down below's a pond I know You can swim in it if you please And if you come 'round when the mill shuts down You can see what chivalry means Let's steal away in the noonday sun It's time for a summertime dream On a trip on down to wonderland, in love among the flowers Where time gets lost with no straw boss, tallying up the hours Where the road runs down by the butternut grove To old Bill Skinner's stream Do tell at the noonday bell It's time for a summertime dream Birds in all creation will be twittering in the trees And down below's a pond I know, you can swim in it if you please And if you come 'round when the mill shuts down You can see what chivalry means Let's steal away in the noonday sun It's time for a summertime dream
