Long Way Back Home From the railhead to the boatyard, from the factory to the farm From the mine to the millyard, I've weathered the storm From the bar room to the bedpost I've wasted my days All I have is my drink and the time left to think While time slips away Just look at my face as you tell me goodbye You'll see what I'm after by the look in my eye Just walk away and leave me alone It's a long way back home Now in case you should ask me, what it is that I've done Well I say I'm a soldier who once had a son But my son doesn't know me, that's his right to choose Oh say can you see, my best friend is me I'm a friend I could use Just look at my face as you tell me goodbye You'll see what I'm after by the look in my eye Just walk away and leave me alone It's a long way back home Now the pages have faded, the story grows cold And the plot falls to ashes like the ruins of old Those rats in my rafters, they're after my shoes And anything else they can find on the shelf I've said they could use Just look at my face as you tell me goodbye You'll see what I'm after by the look in my eye Just walk away and leave me alone It's a long way back home It's a long way back home
