Never Say Trust Me The sky above is filled with stars The road is long and no cars are in sight With one hand on the wheel I've been Driving all day, I can drive all night I'm headed for home with one thing on my mind, yeah Every hotel I have seen Has arborite chairs, arborite dreams Office parties and wedding balls And tacky pictures on the walls Pretty barmaid to and fro The bar band plays the songs we know She gets into Twist And Shout And it's closing time and I'm down and out That's my second home, yeah, what more can I say Lord You should never say trust me It's already been done, it's already ready been done Beneath the seas, beneath the trees and under the sun Never say trust me, my faith in you is all you need Love is all I need The sky above is filled with stars May God bless you is all I can say Cats and dogs and baby's smiles Will drive my lonliness away What will be will be, yeah, that is all that I know girl You should never say trust me 'Cause I know you'll be there, yes I know you'll be there I'll be as right as rain can be, this is our love affair Never say trust me, my faith in you is all you need Love is all I need You should never say trust me It's already been done, it's already ready been done Beneath the seas, beneath the trees and under the sun And under the sun
