Rainbow Trout In the name of love she came This foolish winsome girl She was all decked out like a rainbow trout Swimming up stream in the world And she said "Please, please, I've lost my way The current is too strong In the name of love, kind sir I pray In the name of love" So I took her by the hand, she took me by the will She was all dolled up like a blue eyed pup Looking for something to spill And she said "Please, please, I've lost my way The current is too strong In the name of love, kind sir I pray In the name of love" In the name of love she came This foolish winsome girl She was all decked out like a rainbow trout Swimming upstream in the world And she said "Please, please, I've lost my way The current is too strong Then she gave one flip of the rainbow tip of her tail And she swam back down And she said "Please, please, I've lost my way The current is too strong In the name of love, kind sir I pray, in the name of love"
