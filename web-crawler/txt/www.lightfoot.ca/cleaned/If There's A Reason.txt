If There's A Reason If you should need me deep in the night My arms will open in shades of twilight If there's a reason for living without me Just let me know and I'll move on Down to the station With the big wheels burning Gonna get my ticket To play out that role which I've been given Home is where the heart is But at times a good home must be broken The wine has grown bitter From these harsh words we have spoken If there's a chance for someone else To make you feel life is worth living Give it a try oh lady Just let me know and I'll move on If you should need me deep in the night At shades of twilight If there's a reason for living without me Just let me know and I'll go on living
