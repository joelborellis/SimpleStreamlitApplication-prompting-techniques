Wherefore And Why When I awoke this morning, something inside of me Told me this would be my day I heard the morning train, I felt the wind change Too many times I'm on my way Come on sunshine, what can you show me Where can you take me to make me understand The wind can shake me, brothers forsake me The rain can touch me, but can I touch the rain And then I saw the sunrise above a cotton sky Like a candycane delight I saw the milkman, I saw the business man I saw the only road in sight Then I got to thinking what makes you want to go To know the wherefore and the why So many times now, oh Lord I can't remember If it's September or July Come on sunshine, what can you show me Where can you take me to make me understand The wind can shake me, brothers forsake me The rain can touch me, but can I touch the rain Then all at once it came to me, I saw the wherefore And you can see it if you try It's in the sun above, it's in the one you love You'll never know the reason why Come on sunshine, what can you show me Where can you take me to make me understand The wind can shake me, brothers forsake me The rain can touch me, but can I touch the rain So much to lose, so much to gain
