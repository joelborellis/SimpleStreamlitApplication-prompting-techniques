The Gypsy Step inside my tent, said she, I'd like to read your palm Leave the dollar in the jar, this won't take very long Leave the circus noise behind Close your eyes, relax your mind I'll tell you if you should quit now or if you should go on Then I said, "Now what do you see" She said, "deedly-dum, deedly-dee" "Where'll I go oh, what'll I be" She said, "deedly-dum, deedly-dee" She threw some sawdust in the air and her hands began to shake She told me the town where I was born and she almost knew the date She lit a candle with her eyes and then she made the table rise She took the dollar from the jar and then she guessed my weight Then I said, "Now what do you see," she said, "deedly-dum, deedly-dee" "Your are so old, your are so wise, deedly-dum, deedly-die" "Give me a sign, tell it to me," she said, "deedly-dum, deedly-dee" Then she spoke most quietly, oh, deedly-dum, deedly-dee" When you were a child at school they taught you quite a lot You were told when you should speak and when you should not You were taught to read and write, to take your lessons home at night A little knowledge serves you well but the golden rule does not Then I said, "Now what do you mean," she said, "deedly-dum, deedly-dee" "Where'll I go, what'll I be," she said, "deedly-dum, deedly-dee" Then when I came home that night to lie awake in bed I thought of that old gypsy and the words that she had said And now I see with due respect, the more we learn the worse we get So if you feel you've no regrets, go have your fortune read Then I said, "Now what do you mean," she said, "deedly-dum, deedly-dee" "Where'll I go, what'll I be," she said, "deedly-dum, deedly-dee" "Your are so old, your are so wise, deedly-dum, deedly-die" "Give me a sign, tell it to me," she said, "deedly-dum, deedly-dee" "Where'll I go, what'll I be," she said, "deedly-dum, deedly-dee" "Your are so old, your are so wise, deedly-dum, deedly-die" "Give me a sign, tell it to me," she said, "deedly-dum, deedly-dee"
