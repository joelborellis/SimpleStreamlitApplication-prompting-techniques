Hail Hero Hail hero, hail hero, child of the sun All covered with flowers still having your fun Hail hero, hail hero, birds in the sky Are building their nests in the rafters close by Hail hero, hail hero, child of your fate Come into the kitchen don't stand by the gate And show us your wisdom before it's too late Hail hero, hail hero, let me see you smile You been gone for so damn long, I wish you'd stay awhile And the swimming hole is still up yonder Waiting for a barefoot boy to come And the old mill creek still sings its warning Dancing through the meadow in the sun
