Take Care Of Yourself by Hoffman-Klein Look both ways before you cross the street, don't run up and down the stairs Don't talk to strangers that you may meet, don't stand on any rocking chairs Take care of yourself, while I'm away, darling don't worry I'll be okay Just take care of yourself and please be true, when I come home, I'll take care of you Don't run around, go to sleep too late, be as good as you can be And if some fellow asks you for a date, just tell him you belong to me Take care of yourself, while I'm away, darling don't worry I'll be okay Just take care of yourself and please be true, when I come home, I'll take care of you
