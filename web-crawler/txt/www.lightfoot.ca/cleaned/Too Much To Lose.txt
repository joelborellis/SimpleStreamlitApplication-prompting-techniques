Too Much To Lose Pardon me if I'm leaving in a hurry can't you see There's too much to lose for me to stay around I've played your game, obeyed your rules The best that I know how Gonna get out while the game don't get me down It's been a long, long day and now it's gone, gone I won't see you again before the dawn There's too much to lose for me to stay around So I'll just cash in the chips and leave this town Pardon me if I don't turn back or even say goodbye I surely have enjoyed your cup of tea Got no more time to gamble on a thing that ain't too sure And the dust cloud on the edge of town is me If you ever feel that you should want to get in touch somehow Forget it, that's all in yesterday Forgiving is to lovers as trusting is to fools And of losing there is nothing I can say It's been a long, long day and now it's gone, gone I won't see you again before the dawn There's too much to lose for me to stay around So I'll just cash in the chips and leave this town It's been a long, long day and now it's gone, gone I won't see you again before the dawn There's too much to lose for me to stay around So I'll just cash in the chips and leave this town
