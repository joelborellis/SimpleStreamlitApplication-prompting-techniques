Just A Little Bit Do you ever get tired of hanging out, just a little bit Do you ever get tired of the old routine Do you ever get tired of the blue jeans, just a little bit Do you ever get tired of making the scene Down by the back step checking out dawn, down by the sundeck, give a big yawn Do you ever get tired of mowing the lawn Do you ever get tired of a telephone, just a little bit Do you ever get tired of a telephone bill Do you ever get tired of a cheap thrill, just a little bit Do you ever get tired of curing your ills Down by the clothesline picking up sheets, down by the hoe line picking up beets Ever get tired with the food we eat, just a little bit Do you ever get tired of an upset, just a little bit Do you ever get tired of being on time Do you ever get tired of a cigarette, just a little bit Do you ever get tired of hearing me whine Down at the dog house picking up doo, down at the deadwood seeing what's new Do you ever get tired of shining them shoes, just a little bit Do you ever get tired of worrying, just a little bit Do you ever get tired of singing the blues Do you ever get tired of the clothes you wear, just a little bit Do you ever get tired of combing your hair Down by the schoolyard smokes on the lawn, down by the pool hall money's all gone Do you ever get tired of me singing this song Do you ever get tired of the Olympic Games, just a little bit Do you ever get tired of calling me names Do you ever get tired of a-moving on, just a little bit Do you ever get tired of hauling that flame Pick up the bread pan, pick up the dough, pick up the deadpan, pick up the show Ever get tired of shoveling snow Do you ever get tired of hanging out, just a little bit Do you ever get tired of taking that shower Do you ever get tired of hanging in, a little bit Do you ever get bored with the CN Tower Down by the mailbox pick up the news, trying to find a new point of view Do you ever get tired of shining them shoes, just a little bit Just a little bit, just a little bit, just a little bit
