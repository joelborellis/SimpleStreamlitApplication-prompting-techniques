Wild Strawberries If I had a dollar, if I had a cent I would play most anywhere, if it would pay my rent I'd be living on the downside in my old apartment For the rest of my days People always ask why the world is on the run People like you and like me Is it really true you can really never win Moving to the upside, tell me when does the fun begin Deep as the sea and as wild as the weather We will go just you and me to pick wild strawberries together Or be living on our own in a cabin in a meadow Or meandering alone we can face the world forever or we'll Hit the bounding main or be on a railroad train Hit the boundless tide or be on a steamboat ride Hit the bounding main or be on a midnight plane Hit the pounding tide or be on a rainbow ride People often ask me just the way it must feel To be standing up here with you down there Let it now be known that throughout all of these years I have been wearing polka dot underwear Deep as the sea and as wild as the weather We will go just you and me to gather crabapples together And be wandering along toward a cabin in the meadow Or meandering alone, we can face the world together or we'll Hit the bounding main or be on a railroad train Hit the boundless tide or be on a steamboat ride Hit the bounding main or be on a midnight plane Hit the pounding tide or be on a rainbow ride People always ask why the world is on the slide People like you and like me Is it really true there will be no place left to hide Turning to the upside, when does the fun begin Deep as the sea and as wild as the weather We might go just you and me to pick wild strawberries together Or be living on our own in a cabin in a meadow And the cows will come home They can face the world forever and we'll Hit the bounding main or be on a railroad train Hit the boundless tide or be on a steamboat ride Hit the bounding main or be on a midnight plane Hit the pounding tide or be on a rainbow ride Hit the bounding main or be on a midnight plane
