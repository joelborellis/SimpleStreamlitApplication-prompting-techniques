A Tree Too Weak To Stand I see a place where candles burn And lovers rest tonight The hollow sound inside me now Keeps telling me to write But songs of love will never leave Love's feelings undefiled The tide has turned, the waves roll in The waters fill my eyes The price of lust has risen till the ceiling will not stand The tears I shed were not in shame, the world was in my hands If trust was just a simple thing then trusting I would be But deep within my soul I know it's better to be free The days fly by, the waves roll in, but freedom has not come I fear my faith will soon give out, my senses come undone My role is played, the demon dogs come stealing o'er land And foolish I would climb once more a tree too weak to stand I see a place where candles burn and lovers rest tonight The hollow sound inside me now keeps telling me to write But songs of love should not be sung where staying is not planned And foolish I would climb once more a tree too weak to stand And foolish I would climb once more a tree too weak to stand
