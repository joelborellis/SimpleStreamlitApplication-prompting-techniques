Inspiration Lady She's my inspiration lady Inspiration everywhere She's my inspiration lady She lights candles in the air In the warmth of a morning sun And at night when the day is done She's my inspiration lady, my anticipation lady Sees my situation every day Seems like every time I see her, she's got something on her mind When she tells the age old story of a life she left behind In the warmth of the morning light, she will turn and hold me tight She's my inspiration lady, soft, sad situation lady Sees my situation every day Seems like I will always love her, inspiration every day And I like to think, hey maybe, I can drive her blues away In the warmth of the morning sun and at night when the day is done She's my inspiration lady, she's my kind reaction lady Sees my situation every day She's my inspiration lady, my anticipation lady She's my inspiration all the way
