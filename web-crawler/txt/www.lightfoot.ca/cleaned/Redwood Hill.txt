Redwood Hill I climbed the Redwood Hill, 'twas on a rainy day To rise above the throng and talk with Mother Nature for a while She told me of her love for the children in her trust And of her grave concern, for the likes of you and me and us Crying though she was, she did speak these tender words The things that I am, I could not change for any man I tried to comfort her, ah but she would not be still And how the rain did fall, as I found my way back down the Redwood Hill I tried to comfort her, ah but she would not be still I'll not forget that day, when Mother Nature cried on Redwood Hill I'll not forget that day, when Mother Nature cried on Redwood Hill
