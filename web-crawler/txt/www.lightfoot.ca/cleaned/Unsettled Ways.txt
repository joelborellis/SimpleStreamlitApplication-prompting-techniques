Unsettled Ways Forgive me my unsettled ways Don't linger in time or finger what's mine Don't make me do what you wouldn't do yourself Forgive me the bad things I do Don't ask me to change or exchange what I am For something else, you know that wouldn't do If time gets too heavy and you can no longer bear it And you need someone to share it Tell me girl, I'll try to make amends Forgive me the ways of my heart Don't try to pretend or lend me your love Don't ask of me what you wouldn't ask yourself If time gets too heavy and you can no longer bear it And you need someone to share it Tell me girl, I'll try to make amends Forgive me my unsettled ways Don't linger in time or finger what's mine Don't make me do what you wouldn't do yourself Don't make me do what you wouldn't do yourself
