Anything For Love Lyrics by Gordon Lightfoot / Music by David Foster In my life In my time and in each line I've ever sung and in my life Was it my imagination or are you still the one Who lingers on I'd do anything for you, you'd do anything for me We'd do anything for love Oh you'd use any means and I would try any scheme for love We'd do anything for love Once or twice, in my loneliness I watched the world go by There was I, one too many miles beyond where you might say Some luck was due, after all We could have touched the sky, you had no alibi because We'd do anything for love Oh I would try any means, to have you in all my dreams because You'd do anything for love Not long a go as I rememeber Once upon a dark and windy day When love looked like a dying ember Before you came to call The beauty of it all I thought I'd lost and yet Cause in my life, here in my mind in it now shines A guiding light, never again will I lose my way Oh I would not tell a lie and you had no alibi because We'd do anything for love Oh you'd use any means and I would try any scheme for love Simply anything for love Oh I would do anything, just about anything because We'd do anything for love, anything for love
