The Way I Feel The way I feel is like a robin Whose babes have flown to come no more Like a tall oak tree alone and crying When the birds have flown and the nest is bare (Electric version) Now a woman Lord is like a young bird And the tall oak tree is a young man's heart Among its boughs you'll find her nesting When the nights are cool she is warm and dry Your coat of green it will protect her Her wings will grow your love will too But all too soon your mighty branches Will cease to hold her she'll fly from you Now the way I feel is like a robin Whose babes have flown to come no more Like a tall oak tree alone and crying When the birds have flown and the nest is bare When the birds have flown and the nest is bare
