A Lesson In Love Nothing is for certain, that's what the showman said First you must open the curtain And stand them on their heads There can be no inhibitions, no prima donna ways If you want to pass the audition And times is tough these days Remember when Mr. Barnum presented Jenny Lind They named a candy after her, a circus after him End of my story, the rest is history She in all of her glory, he lived quietly He needed her, she needed him, as sure as the sky above In a way it was for them A lesson in love, a lesson in love You look like the moonglow that follows me home Always makes me turn around, won't leave me alone First to come are the midgets, a monkey and a kid Followed by those two one-armed jugglers, the ego and the id Songs of the season, apples of the sun There is no rhyme or reason, just a time for each and every one Hang on Mr. Barnum, hang on Jenny Lind We will meet you in streets of gold where eternity begins We will let it all hang out, go hand in glove Life was meant to live and learn, a lesson in love, a lesson in love
