Mountains And Marian All is well, I've made my peace where highways never end Yesterday's a memory, today is just a friend For the mountains and Marian are calling me again And the red pines will bow their heads The rivers and the watersheds Will swallow up my tears, all is well I left the cold midwestern towns behind There's a semi up the road ahead, I'll take him in my time For the hot blooded mountain love is calling me again And the vagabond within me cries, the wind and rain might burn my eyes But I won't feel the pain For the mountains and Marian Will greet me there as only she can do All is well, as I swing up to the border bent for hell And the service station man agreed I didn't look too well But the mountains and Marian are calling out to me And I got my bed roll on my back, and everything that I could pack To see me on my way, all is well I've made my peace and man I'm feeling fine And the losers that I left behind I'll think about some other time For the border men were all my friends they couldn't find a dime And the prairie towns go sailing by, Saskatchewan there's mud in your eye I'm leaving you behind There'll be hot blooded mountain love to satisfy my soul And the red pines will bow their heads, the rivers and the watersheds Will carry us along And the mountains and Marian will greet me there as only she can do All is well, the foothills are coming into sight Today is just a memory, the future is tonight And the red pines will bow their heads, the rivers and the watersheds Will carry us along And the mountains and Marian will greet me there as only she can do
