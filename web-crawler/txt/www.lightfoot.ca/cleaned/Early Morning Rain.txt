Early Morning Rain In the early morning rain with a dollar in my hand With an aching in my heart and my pockets full of sand I'm a long way from home and I miss my loved ones so In the early morning rain with no place to go Out on runway number nine, big seven-o-seven set to go But I'm stuck here in the grass with a pain that evergrows Now the liquor tasted good and the women all were fast Well now there she goes my friend, she's a-rolling down at last Hear the mighty engines roar, see the silver wing on high She's away and westward bound, far above the clouds she'll fly Where the morning rain don't fall and the sun always shines She'll be flying over my home in about three hours time This old airport's got me down, it's no earthly good to me 'Cause I'm stuck here on the ground, as cold and drunk as I can be You can't jump a jet plane like you can a freight train So I'd best be on my way in the early morning rain
