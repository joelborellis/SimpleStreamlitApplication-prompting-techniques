Maybe I try too hard sometimes, it's a magic life I live Maybe I fly too high sometimes, maybe I've too much to give But for now my darling to the highway I must go Tonight I'll paint life's picture in my magic minstrel show Maybe someday I can relate to all the things that we hold dear You know I can hardly wait, come and whisper in my ear And so my darling to myself I shall be true Painting life's pictures as all magic minstrels do Will you go for one last stand - yes I will, yes I will Will you give me one last hand - yes I will, yes I will Will you keep on going strong - yes I will, yes I will Going strong the whole night long - yes I will, yes I will Now and forever to ourselves we shall be true Painting life's pictures as all magic minstrels do Maybe someday I can make you see, when I've left no stone unturned Any day I may be set free when my lesson has been learned And so my darling to the highway I must go Tonight I'll paint life's pictures in my magic minstrel show Even though I'm crying to myself I shall be true Painting life's pictures as all magic minstrels do
