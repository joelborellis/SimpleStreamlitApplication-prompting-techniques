Tattoo Whatever you think of me, I'm still your friend So other than nothing what's new The water's still flowing, through the rose on my skin This here tattoo is for you The boys at the parlor downtown Didn't waste any time putting it down Time has been wasting away I can see it Go sailing on by as it slips through my fingers The bow and the wave never wait for tomorrow They just keep on rolling as straight as an arrow Goodnight Girl of my dreams, you get better each day I wish I could see you somehow Girl that I love is there no other way This here tattoo is for now I'd been out drinking all day I got carried away at the parlor last night This summer rose is for you it's no wonder I bothered to wander back into the parlor It's red and in bloom and it's more than one color It lives on forever for just a few dollars, good night Whatever you think of me, I'm still your friend So baby whatever you do Now that it's taken its permanent home This here tattoo is for you The boys at the parlor downtown Didn't waste any time putting it down Time has been wasting away, you know time doesn't Wait for nobody to find what they're after It just keeps on rolling on down the deep canyons And through the green meadows into the broad ocean, good night Whatever you think of me, I'm still your friend So other than nothing what's new The water's still flowing, through the rose on my skin This here tattoo is for you The water's still flowing, through the rose on my skin This here tattoo is for you
