 Hangdog Hotel Room  Hangdog Hotel Room           I go in for singing, I do it for my pay But the kind of gig I can really dig Happens just at the break of day With a few good friends and neighbors Into playing the nighttime tunes So pass the jar and that old guitar in this hangdog hotel room I believe in magic, a little monkeyshines But the kind of row I can really hoe is playing in tune on time With rhythms all around us we're like weavers at the loom So pass the jar and that old guitar in this hangdog hotel room Oh Lord it feels so good to play a nighttime tune So pass the jar and that old guitar in this hangdog hotel room When it comes to morning and going out at night Well the kind of test that I like the best is treating the wrong girl right And a few good friends and neighbors in to playing the nighttime tunes So pass the jar and that old guitar in this hangdog hotel room Oh Lord it feels so good to play a nighttime tune So pass the jar and that old guitar in this hangdog hotel room With rhythms all around us we're like weavers at the loom So pass the jar and that old guitar in this hangdog hotel room
