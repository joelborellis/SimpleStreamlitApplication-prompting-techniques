River Of Light       Heading off on a river at peace in the cool of an evening Heading off on a river of light, be part of a river at night Nice to be on a river sometimes, like a June bug travelling Heading off on a ribbon of song, been away from the river too long Good to be on a river somewhere, like a milkweed travelling Heading off on a ribbon of dreams, be a part of a river it seems Can you tell me how long must I travel on   I won't be looking up old friends I won't be looking up old friends ever again     I spent my life taking my time and I can't change anything Take a look at my river of light, be a part of a river at night Nice to be on a river at peace, like a June bug travelling Heading off on a river at last, my tears will be all in the past Good to be on a river somewhere, like a milkweed travelling Heading down where the water runs deep, down deep where the fish are asleep now Can you tell me how long must I travel on I won't be looking up old friends I won't be looking up old friends ever again Trouble don't mean nothing to me and I had my share of it Heading off on a river of light, be a part of a river at night Nice to be on a river at peace in the cool of an evening Heading off on a silver moonlight, maybe love'll find me tonight Good to be on a river somewhere, like a milkweed travelling Heading off on a ribbon of dreams, be a part of a river it seems Can you tell me how long must I travel on I won't be looking up old friends I won't be looking up old friends ever again, ever again, ever again
