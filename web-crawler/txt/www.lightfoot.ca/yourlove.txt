 Your Love's Return  Â  Your Love's Return Come to the door my pretty one Put on your rings and precious things Hide all your tears as best you can Try to recall what used to be Roses are waiting for dewdrops to fall Climbing your windows and walls  Bells in steeple are ringing, singing Listen to them talk about your love's return Let me come in my pretty one And try to undo what I have done For I must be forgiven now I will not lose what I have won Roses are waiting for dewdrops to fall Climbing your windows and walls Leaves in the garden are falling, calling Listen to them talk about your love's return Let me come in my precious one Wake from your sleep and take me home Open your eyes and look my way I cannot leave your love alone Roses are waiting for dewdrops to fall Climbing your windows and walls Bells in steeple are ringing, singing Listen to them talk about your love's return
