Gotta Get Away               I'm on my way, got no time to waste Places to go, people to chase Gonna grab my comb 'n my toothpaste  Gotta get away from here Twenty-one years from the day I was born I was working on the night shift tooting my horn Through sheets of rain, through sleet and storm You come to me  You were the girl with the summer sunshine In your eyes and in your smile You were the one I thought loved me It was something I never could quite believe Gotta get away from here I'm a real bad loser that's what I am Gonna grab my hat and my hexagram You can stick my money in an old tin can I think I fell in love again I was down by the bus stop biding my time I was hitching a ride with a friend of mine I was almost gone, I was over the line I said what's come over me You were the girl with the sound of springtime In your songs and in your voice You were the one I thought loved me It was something I never could quite believe Gotta get away from here Gotta get back to you I'm gonna make it today, I'm gonna get on my toes Been awake so long I'm getting ready to doze Gonna grab my bag and a few old clothes Gotta get away from here Gotta get back to you I gotta get away, gotta get away Gotta get away, gotta get away Gotta get away
