Return Into Dust       They said seek and ye shall find  All I ever find was this trouble in my mind  One of these days I will set myself free  Ain't no one else who can put the bite on me  But until then I'll do what I can    They said seek and ye shall know  All I ever sought was a heaven here below or so it goes    The time meant for us, like the rose    We will return into dust     They said sow and ye shall reap  All I ever saw was this dream that I can't keep  One little wheat field yields a little grain  Rough times, tough times are all one and the same  But as for now, time don't allow  They said search and destroy  All that you hold dear, like the laughter you keep hearing through the years  A time meant for us, all our fears  Will return into dust  They said ask and it shall be  And all I can tell you is baby it ain't free  One more request and then I'll be on my way  Why pay the price, love start a brand new day  But until then, let us be friends  They said drink and be restored  All I ever drank made me wind up on the floor and what is more  A mind turned to rust, that's for sure  We will return into dust  Through the years, a time meant for us, all our fears  Will return into dust
