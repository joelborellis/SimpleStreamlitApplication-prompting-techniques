 Sixteen Miles  Sixteen Miles Early in the morning when the dew is on Each and every rose bud you will find me gone So knock me down and pick me up and knock me down again Break my heart steal my gold and slander my good name Seven lonely hours on the morning train Takes me to a place where I won't come back again Seven lonely Pullmans speeding down the line Taking me away from an old love of mine Sixteen miles to seven lakes way up among the pines In some hidden valley where the twirling river twines Where the fish swim up and down and the sparkling water falls Where the thunder rolls and the lonely puma calls Somewhere on the mountain I'll take another name Rid my mind of memories and start my life again Somewhere in the wilderness I'll build a cabin small Then forget so I won't remember you at all
