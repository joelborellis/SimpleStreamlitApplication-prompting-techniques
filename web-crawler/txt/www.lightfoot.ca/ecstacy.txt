 Ecstacy Made Easy  Ecstacy Made Easy       I can always try to forget somehow What's a part of the past  Have a little laughter if you please  I won't even mind if it takes awhile I've got time on my hands  I feel another chapter in the breeze  Somebody touched my heart string Somebody made my heart sing Somebody stole my heart away Nobody's saying their sorry It's a mighty sweet music You can dance all night Put some wood on the fire right now Ecstacy made easy  Ecstasy I ask you, are you a name Or just another patron with a smile Let me analyze you, are you a flame Or just the dying embers of a kiss run wild Somebody found my heart string Somebody made my heart sing Somebody touched my heart last night Somebody set me in flight It's a mighty sweet music Take a chance they say Put a flame in the old hot stove Ecstasy made easy It's a mighty sweet music You can dance all night Put some fire in the old iron stove Ecstasy made easy, made easy I hope I never lose what belongs to me By the right of my birth At midnight sailing out of Perth Getting under way we turned 'er westward bound On that southern sea to see what ecstasy was worth
