 Fading Away  Fading Away I was at the breakwall, I was looking at the sea In back of an eight ball in some misery There on the horizon stood a mighty ship of fools They were headed into the harbour with all their broken rules Whenever I'm feeling lonely I can just pick up the phone Or I can go to the movies or just stay at home alone They're better off to be someplace that's a Good long way from home Anyway I can lose myself, the dawn is breaking, I'm hesitating I'm  Fading away, fading away  They sailed right up to meet me, I said what's it all about Please try to excuse me, we can work things out If you've ever wondered if that mighty ship is real Let me tell ya 'bout it brother, it was something you could feel Whenever I'm feeling lonely I let twilight set the tone Or I can go to the movies or just stay at home alone They're better off to be someplace that's a good long way to roam Ain't living high on the hog right now Dawn is breaking, I'm hesitatin', I'm Fading away, fading away One more day on the calendar in my mind I am down around the breakwall putting in some time The whole ship of fools has gotten safely under way And I was proud to be a part of what it was they had to say Whenever I'm feeling lonely I can just pick up the phone Or I can go to the movies or just stay at home alone They're better off to be someplace that's a good long piece from home Anyway I can lose myself Dawn is breaking, I'm hesitating, I'm Fading away, fading away Fading away, fading awayÂ
