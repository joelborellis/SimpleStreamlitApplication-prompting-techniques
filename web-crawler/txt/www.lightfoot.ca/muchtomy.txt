 Much To My Surprise  Much To My Surprise I saw two dreamers dreaming, they almost caused a spark I saw two lovers in paradise Right back at the start I saw two minds in the world set free But it almost broke my heart Isn't it strange to be right now Having you close to me Much to my surprise  I saw two schemers scheming, they almost caused a lark They were two brave souls on a wild blue spree, right back at the park They were like two ships and they sailed right by each other in the dark Wouldn't you like to be right now, out where the actors play So much for your disguise I saw two souls out searching, they said their last goodbyes And I saw two hearts of passion then, much to my surprise I saw two hearts on passion bent, the kind which mystifies It is so strange to be right now, having you on my knee Much to my surprise I gotta make you see somehow I saw two minds that wandered, they almost caused a wreck They were all checked out for a wild blue sea Til someone cried, "Hit the deck" I saw two minds in the world set wise, but I almost broke my specs Wouldn't you like to be right now, out where the actors play So much for your disguise, much to my surprise
