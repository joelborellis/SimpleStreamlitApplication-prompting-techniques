 You'll Still Be Needing Me    You'll Still Be Needing Me                 If I had my way, I would say it's over darling If I could be brave, I would say I'm leaving you But I must stay on till hope is gone 'Cause girl I know, anywhere you go you'll still be needing me If you feel you can't make it on your own my darling I'll be on your side when you can't find anyone But for now let's try, just to get by Let the tide roll out, let the tide roll in, it's time to sink or swim La la la la la, la la la la la la la la La la la la la, la la la la la la la la If I could be strong, I'd be gone tomorrow morning Still I play the part, making like a broken toy But I must stay on til all hope is gone 'Cause girl I know, anywhere I go you'll still be needing me Let the tide roll out, let the tide roll in, it's time to sink or swim La la la la la, la la la la la la la la La la la la la, la la la la la la la la
