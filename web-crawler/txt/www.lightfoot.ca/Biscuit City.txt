Biscuit City I'd like to be in Biscuit City, with my banjo in my hand I don't need no long vacation in some foreign land 'Cause the sound of my own breathing Has been turning to a sigh I wish that I could make the time To be in Biscuit City by and by Oh the water is of emerald and the beach is white as snow And everyone's got money and no place to go In a land of milk and honey, it can really make you smile And if I had a ticket I would stay in Biscuit City for a while All the girls are in bikinis, all the boys are in the buff With the baby in between and that makes three of us And the streets are all so quiet and the walls are squeaky clean I think you ain't been nowhere 'til the town of Biscuit City you have seen I'd rather be in Biscuit City, with my banjo in my hand Than take a big vacation in some foreign land 'Cause the sound of my own breathing has been turning to a sigh If it were not for misfortune I would be in Biscuit City by and by If it were not for misfortune I would stay in Biscuit City 'til I die
