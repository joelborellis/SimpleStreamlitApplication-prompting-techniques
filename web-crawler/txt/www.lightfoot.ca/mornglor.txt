 Morning Glory  Morning Glory             Pretty faces everywhere  A few hard cases stop and stare  They've got charm that is not right  Pretty faces late at night Morning Glory what's the story, will it ever end I've been all the way to Biscayne Bay And all the way back again, all the way back again  I remember our old rendezvous  The key was kept inside a shoe Those moments will remain frozen in time  Morning Glory's on my mind What's the story Morning Glory, will it ever end I've been all the way to Biscayne Bay And all the way back again, all the way back again It seems like only yesterday She married me and carried me away I found out what life was all about Morning Glory threw me out Hey Morning Glory what's the story, will it ever end I've been all the way to Biscayne Bay And all the way back again, all the way back again Alimony, palimony, puts a dent in me I've been all the way to Biscayne Bay For a dip in the shining sea, dip in the shining sea Pretty faces everywhere A few hard cases stop and stare Even when I know it ain't my day A lot of good faces anyway Morning Glory what's that story, what is it to be I've been all the way to Biscayne Bay For a dip in the shining sea, dip in the shining sea What's the story Morning Glory, will it ever end I've been all the way to Biscayne Bay And all the way back again, all the way back again Hey Morning Glory what's the story, will it ever end I've been all the way to Biscayne Bay And all the way back again, all the way back again
