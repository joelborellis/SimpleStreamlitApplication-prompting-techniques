 Fine As Fine Can Be  Fine As Fine Can Be You're as soft as the rose You're as sweet as the honey You're as warm as the bright morning sun You're as cool as the breeze on the last days of April You're as fine as fine can be You're like time is to space You're like faith is to trusting You're like blue is to feeling unkind You're like joy is for love, You're like dreams are for chasing You're as fine as fine can be And when I am gone my thoughts are all with you You're my little angel you see You're as bright as the moon You're as light as a feather You're as fine as fine can be  Like the rain is for the crops You're like food for my thoughts You're like true is for knowing what's not You're like leaves are for trees You're like bees are for buzzing You're as fine as fine can be You're as bright as the moon You're as light as a feather You're as fine as fine can be
