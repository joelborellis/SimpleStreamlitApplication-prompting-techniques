If I Could             If I could sing like the poets and kings of this world If I could rise like the wind o'er the tides of the sea I would sing you to sleep my love with sweet melody And let you dream away till the morning light returned again To take you away from me If I could speak with the tongues of the masters of old If I could tame all the fleeting perceptions I hold Would I stand in the marketplace before you To be shouted down without any warning at all, to be stood by the wall And shot by the man in blue If I could run with the grace of a sun colored stallion If I could fly like the great silver jets in the morning If I caused the wind to change with one wave of my hand And if I could play the final symphony and set it free Would it mean anything to you If I could stand like the rusty old man in his armour If I could ride the steed that he rode in his time I would turn his head away to the river And let him wander through the meadow grass, wild and free For everyone to see (Repeat 1st verse)
