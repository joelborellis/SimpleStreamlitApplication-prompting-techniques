 Too Late For Prayin'  Too Late For Prayin' It was only yesterday When I heard the teacher say Patiently, one and two make three We were children, you and me Let us pray for the ones they call The children of today  Nothing left but promises Nothing much is certain All we see is want and need across the board Why thank you lord We're living in the glory of your care  Skies of blue have all turned brown To the sound of sighing Lord abide, let us stem the tide Of broken dreams Sometimes you seem to tell us It's too late for praying See the ocean wild and blue Think of all that's in her She will not surrender to the likes of us But then she must They tell us, wise men tell us, it's too late For each child with eyes that smile There'll be ten more crying Lord abide, let us stem the time Of helplessness But then I guess we're living Is it too late for trying Nothing here but grains of sand Nothing much worth saving Guess we've all got problems of our own to bear And still we share Tomorrow could get better than today To the ones who loved in vain Will you be beholding Lord abide, let us stem the tide Of broken dreams Sometimes you seem to tell us It's too late for praying
