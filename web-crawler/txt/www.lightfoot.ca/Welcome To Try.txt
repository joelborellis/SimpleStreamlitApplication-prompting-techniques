Â  Welcome To Try I have been down in the valley of tears I have stood on the highest peak For the best part of a week Battered and bruised I had pulled myself through Every scene I would never repeat I have hung out with the beasts of the field And with them I've spent many long nights Got in some awful bad fights I came unstuck I was down on my luck And I'm still getting over the bites Sounds of my own heart breaking - not to mention my mind "Nothing can hurt me" a small voice said into a mike "Take a hike" No one will lead me astray anymore You are welcome to try if you like Welcome to try if you like I had been down in the valley so long, I had almost run out of respect Got in right up to my neck Battered but wise to the truth and the lies that no layman would ever accept Reaching for all of the good things in life can provide some surprises I guess It may be the way we are dressed These threads that you see mean so little to me, they don't count when they put us to rest Late about dusk I would start to feel, one more day had been lost Nothing I'd say ever seemed to convey how I felt with that I have dealt All of my children are healthy and sane, they may say anything that they like Say anything that they like Sitting alone in the Blue Ridge Saloon is no place for an angel to be Ladies make faces at me Battered but clean I had pulled my machine off the road, I was too tired to see Wearing a smile like the rim of a cup, I will get down to my final point There is no one left to annoint And the sowing of seed was it good, yes indeed, it thrills me but only to a point Use your imagination, try every trick in the book My mother said with the life that I led I'd be broke, holy smoke All of my children are healthy and wise, they may say anything that they like Say anything that they like If they want to preach and are not within reach, they may say anything that they like Say anything that they like
