Adios, Adios Â  by Lightfoot & Ruth Hash I'll meet you in Michoacan the heart of Mexico Oh I'll meet you in the villa, where I loved you so I'll meet you where cathedral bells ring out across the square So weep no more as time goes by, for my darling I will be there Adios, adios and remember my love Well meet in the springtime 'neath blue skies above I'll meet you my only one, in just a year or so Oh I'll meet you in Michoacan in the heart of old Mexico
