 Betty Called Me In  Betty Called Me In Betty Jo, you made it plain, when first you held me near Even though you caused me pain, you were all the world to me We made love, we had such fun, many fine times went by us Now it's all so hazy and a little bit crazy Betty Jo my heart's on fire, I don't need this crying The next time you see me, in the back seat of a taxi's where I'll be Betty called me in to say goodnight Much to my relief and pure delight I think that was my big love scene I do believe her engine run all right Betty said get ready the time has come I was young and my good life had begun And with the dawn the child in me was gone Betty made a man out of me that night    Betty made my clothes and sewed my jeans Listening to my songs and foolish schemes I think the way she got to me It would seem like a laser beam right to the soul Betty my true love do what you do tonight Where she goes I hope she knows she's right The worst of times and the best of times She was never the kind to kick and bitch and fight         Betty called me in to say goodnight Much to my relief and pure delight And with the dawn the child in me was gone Betty made a man out of me that night    I think that was my big love scene I do believe her engine run all right
