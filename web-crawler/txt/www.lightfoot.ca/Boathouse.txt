Boathouse                               I would rather be at the boathouse  Out of the daily grind  I'd sooner be down at the boathouse  What a way to unwind  Now I don't want to know how it feels to be set back So I'm leaving here on a one-way track  I'd rather be in mosquito alley, out of my right hand lane You ought to see my mosquito tally, all that moves is fair game Now I don't want to know how it feels not to be loose So I'm leaving here on the first caboose I'm leaving here on the first caboose I can't sleep by a gentle ocean  I can't sleep by a waterfall  I can't sleep by a lovely river  I can't sleep ,I can't sleep  Dee dee dee, dee dee dee, dee dee dee dee I would rather sleep at the boathouse, what more can I say I'd sooner eat down at the boathouse, let it carry me away Now I don't want to know how it feels to step aside So I'm leaving here on a wicked ride Or I could be back at the alehouse, with a flagon or two A few blocks south of the jailhouse, with a hole in my shoe Now I don't want to know how it feels to stop a truck So I'm leaving here and wishing you good luck I'm leaving here and wishing you good luck I can't sleep by a peaceful ocean, I can't sleep by a waterfall I can't sleep by a lovely river, I can't sleep, I can't sleep Dee dee dee, dee dee dee, dee dee dee dee I'd rather be in mosquito alley, keeping spiders in line I'd sooner be down at the boathouse, what a way to unwind Now I don't want to know how it feels not to be loose So I'm leaving here on the first caboose I'm leaving here on the first caboose Dee dee dee, dee dee dee, dee dee dee dee
