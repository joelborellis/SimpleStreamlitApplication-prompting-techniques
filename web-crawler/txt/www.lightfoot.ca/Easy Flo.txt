Easy Flo        I was uneasy as uneasy could be  Until she found me and then I could see  We realized we had nothing to fear  We'd be okay now it's been seven years  Think about us if you will  Next time you feel a chill  I was uneasy as a leaf among the trees Oh I turned around, I was down upon my knees Easy come, easy go, easy Flo          I wasn't used to the feeling we had Until I found out it didn't feel bad We were the best of friends we'd ever known We didn't care when they left us alone Think it over if you will Any tme you've had your fill I was alone as any loner ought to be Oh I turned around and she was looking straight at me Easy come, easy go, easy Flo She's with me wherever I may go  One of these days when my coyote don't call When the roof doesn't leak to the wonder of us all Easy come, easy go, easy Flo  I was uneasy as I'd ever been Until I found her I never could win We realized we had nothing to fear We'd be okay now the answer is clear Think about us if you will Next time you feel a chill I was extremely into doing what I please So I turned around and I was down upon my knees Easy come, easy go, easy Flo She's with me wherever I may go Easy come, easy go, easy Flo
